Dr. Lancer’s Skin Reality – Intro
COVID-19 has changed the way we live life. How we socialize, work, sleep and our daily activities have all been altered in some way because of the global pandemic. Wearing a mask is totally normal now, and many of us will continue to wear a mask long after the vaccine. It’s part of our life now, part of our routine. With this new way of life, our at home skincare and hygiene program has also taken on a greater, new meaning.
Spending more time at home has led us to reflect more frequently on how we care for ourselves and what we can do differently. You may have stood in front of your bedroom mirror, seeing yourself from head to toe in only your birthday suit. After studying every aspect of yourself, you might have noticed that your neck could be firmer, your complexion could be fresher, or you would like to work on toning a specific part of your body. Whatever it is, the pandemic has allowed time for you to see what you would like improved and motivates you to make those positive changes for a healthier and happier life, regardless of gender, ancestry or age.
With more awareness on body image and achieving beautiful, glowing skin, the majority of people are starting to understand that complexion, radiance and uniformity influence self-perception and the perception of others in terms of overall health. Many pay closer attention to skin color, texture, qualities of architectural unity and the reflection of lights and shadows, giving them a clearer perception of their current state of wellness. Taking care of your skin is not only about looking good, it’s about keeping your skin and body’s health in check.
To keep skin healthy during COVID-19 and post-pandemic, use these Lancer best-sellers in your at-home skincare routine:
The Method: Polish, Cleanse & Nourish

You’re in for a treat! The Method: Polish is a gentle exfoliator made of pure minerals, pumpkin and pomegranate enzymes and is a favorite at Lancer Dermatology. The product removes dead skin cells and other skin impurities, leaving skin feeling fresh and brighter.
The Method: Cleanse (step #2) removes any remaining impurities left on the skin. The cleanse has a pearl white coloring with a light lemon scent, enriched with a rice amino acid complex and can be used on all skin types.
The Method: Nourish is the final step of the routine and gives skin the hydration it needs year-round. It also seals in vital ingredients that transform your skin to a more youthful, radiant complexion. Adding in a drop or two of the Omega Hydrating Oil will also give your skin that extra boost of hydration and smoothness.

Once you’ve mastered this simple, yet powerful 3-step system, you can add in masks and advanced treatments like Advanced C Radiance Treatment and Advanced Retinol Treatment to continue to improve your skin’s appearance and health.



Advanced C Radiance Treatment with 10% Vitamin C and Retinol brightens your overall skintone while evening and smoothing the complexion. This product should be used in the AM.
Advanced Retinol Treatment with 1.25% Retinol is a nighttime serum that improves texture, tone and skin elasticity while reducing those fine lines and wrinkles. Skin will look plumper, smooth and hydrated after consistent use.



In the coming weeks, this online continuation of Younger: The Breakthrough Anti-Aging Method for Radiant Skin will discuss new aspects of inner and outer beauty in the new era of self-awareness. I will share tips, new products and procedures for the face, neck, decollete, hands, thighs, waist and curves so you can achieve youthful, radiant skin from head to toe. I will also touch on nutrition, the importance of exercise, quality sleep and emotional well being, as that’s all part of the Lancer pillar of health.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/forgetting-something-contour-decollete-please/,"Life before the COVID-19 pandemic. Going to the theater, table for 6 at your favorite restaurant without a care in the world. Remember dinner parties? You were surrounded by great company and a generous amount of food and wine. The glassware, plates and utensils were all of a similar style and complimented each other well. Every element of the dinner party worked together, making the evening a success. Think about that last dinner party you went to.
When Dr. Lancer sees new patients, he uses his dinner party concept as an example of how patients should care for their skin. Most new patients tend to focus on facial skin imperfections, pointing out the obvious blemish or wrinkle. The focus on that one area is so intense, that we don’t notice what’s around it, causing us to neglect parts of the skin that desperately need our attention. It’s important to remember that skincare isn’t just for the forehead to the jawline. The hairline to the chest should be cared for with equal treatment. Think of it this way: The hairline to the chest is like the table at your dinner party. You need everything to match and compliment each other to garner the most beautiful results.
Dr. Lancer’s dinner party philosophy opens our eyes to our current skin’s condition. Your face, neck and chest most likely have different skin tones and textures. Your neck in particular might need the most repair, having deep lines, sagging skin and ultimately showing the most signs of aging. Those deep lines that we notice are actually wrinkles and become more visible over time. “The skin’s appearance on the neck and décolleté can give away a person’s true age, ”says Dr. Lancer. As we age, skin loses elastin and collagen. Elastin allows skin to stretch and bounce back providing a tighter appearance. It gives skin its structure. Collagen is a protein serving as one of the main building blocks for our skin. It keeps our skin from sagging as it holds up the top layer of the skin, giving us that plump, youthful look we desire. While aging is the main reason for a change in the necks appearance, other factors such as UV exposure, pollutants in the environment, poor lifestyle choices and constantly looking down at your phone definitely accelerate skin aging.
While our first instinct is to search the internet for anything that can help repair the skin, it’s important to remember that the neck’s skin needs a specific treatment because of the way the skin differs below the face. The neck and chest in particular have a different cellular structure than facial skin. The skin is thinner and more delicate with less fat under the skin. It also has less oil gland production and often sees signs of dehydration quicker than other areas. With this difference, Dr. Lancer created a unique treatment to give the neck the catch up that it needs.
Contour Decollete is a firming concentrate used to hydrate, sculpt and lift the delicate area of the neck, helping to reverse the signs of aging. Designed for all skin types, Contour Decollete contains Marine Cone Snail Venom, a 5-peptide liposomal system and an acid-free exfoliating blend, giving the neck and decollete the recipe that it needs for repair. Marine Cone Snail Venom is the key to reducing visible signs of aging around the neck and decollete, while the 5-peptide liposomal system mimics the skin’s natural growth factors, encouraging a synergistic, youth-inducing effect on the skin. The acid-free exfoliating blend works to create smoother texture and tone for a visibly lifted, more plump and radiant appearance. Developed for prompt and long-lasting improvements for the delicate neck, décolleté and bust line areas, this lightweight serum immediately absorbs to plump and smooth away surface dehydration, soften the appearance of lines and crepiness, and improve surface texture.
Initially, Contour Decollete should be applied once daily. As your skin becomes acclimated to the product, applications can be increased to twice a day. When using, gently massage the serum into cleansed skin on the neck, decollete and bustline with upward strokes until completely absorbed. As with all Advanced Treatments, Contour Decollete should be used in tandem with The Method: Polish, Cleanse and Nourish for optimal results. And don’t forget your sunscreen! We recommend Dr. Lancer’s Sheer Fluid Sun Shield with SPF 30 to help enhance results and protect the skin from damage caused by UV rays. For everyone that’s concerned that their decollete area will never be the same – know this can be reversable. It just needs a little love, care and the right ingredients to revive it, just like a dinner party.
Forgetting Something? Contour Decollete, Please! was last modified:  March 3rd, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer","Forgetting Something? Contour Decollete, Please!",
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/the-beauty-of-exfoliation/,"Exfoliation is one of those fancy terms for removing debris. An exfoliating product removes debris from the skin’s surface as it stimulates new oxygen flow, new cell metabolism, new protein production, and begins restoring the skin. Skin looks and feels fresh post exfoliation and it helps tremendously with evening out skin tone. It’s important to exfoliate on a daily basis to keep your complexion radiant and healthy. But remember, you’ll need to get every inch of your body – not just your face!
The Method: Polish is the number one exfoliating product at Lancer Skincare. The product was developed from the 1983 / 1984 thought process of its founder, Dr. Lancer, who understood the need to remove debris from an area wanting to be restored before cleansing the skin. When Lancer re-developed the proper theory and practice of skincare, the clinic served as the focus on patient care to develop the Lancer Polish-Cleanse-Nourish protocol. Polish is the first step of the 3-step system and is used to gently remove surface debris and dull, dry surface cells to reveal a brighter, smoother, and more even toned complexion. The product contains a generous mix of crystals, pumpkin and pomegranate enzymes and can be used on the face, neck and décolleté. In addition, there is an alternate version for the body which can be used from the shoulders down. Both products can be used daily or every other day to exfoliate or remove dead skin cells that are interfering with the normal metabolic function of living tissue so that all the active ingredients in Lancer products work better. After The Method: Polish, use The Method: Cleanse to remove any remaining impurities left on the skin and The Method: Nourish to hydrate the skin while providing anti-aging benefits.
Dr. Lancer also developed an instrument so that you can exfoliate your skin from home – the Pro Polish Microdermabrasion Device. Inspired by the PowerPeel Microdermabrasion machine used at Lancer Dermatology, the new patented device allows you to experience optimal exfoliation for the face and body in the privacy of your own home. The device comes equipped with a diamond tipped component for small areas like the face, neck and hands, and has a second attachment for the larger areas of the body. The Pro Polish Microdermabrasion Device was designed to be used 1-2x/week and has 3 power levels to choose from. Some may use it on their face. Some might use it on just their elbows. It can be a broad use mechanical instrument treatment or a focal area of concern treatment device. It varies from person to person. With consistent use, skin should appear smoother, even toned and healthy.
The Method: Polish and Pro Polish Microdermabrasion Device are both crucial to the concept of Lancer Skincare because they promote the idea that you must remove debris – dead, non-functioning interfering skin cells before cleansing, advanced product use and nourishing the skin. It’s important to note that they should not be used on the same day and in the same area because it would be over stimulating the region.
Exfoliation is the key to obtaining beautiful, clean skin so remember to include it in your daily skincare regimen as it will make a huge difference in your complexion from head to toe.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/gentle-exfoliating-peel-pads/,"For a Brighter, Even Complexion in 2021
We are ever-changing. Our wants, fears, lifestyle, circumstances and appearance are constantly in flux. Look at life today. The new normal is working from home in comfy PJs, wearing a mask when in public and staying 6 feet apart. Our mask keeps us safe and healthy, but it can also cause some unwanted changes in our skin. Face coverings often cause skin imperfections like acne, dryness and a rough, uneven skin tone.
To improve dull, uneven skin tone and rough skin texture, Dr. Lancer developed Gentle Exfoliating Peel Pads, a new, effective treatment for all skin types. Featuring 7% Lactic Acid and Bakuchiol, these peel pads gently exfoliate the skin and is recommended for all skin types, including sensitive skin. The product gradually resurfaces and brightens skin with the swipe of a pre-dosed pad and is a gentle alternative to laser resurfacing and chemical peels. These peel pads are to be used after The Method: Cleanse and should be used every other day, in the morning or at night.
So, what’s in these exfoliating pads that make this product so beneficial? Each pad is made from biodegradable bamboo and contains a blend including 7% Lactic Acid, Bakuchiol, Papaya Fruit Extract and Oat Bran Extract.
Diving deeper into our ingredients list…

Lactic Acid is known to exfoliate the upper layers of the skin while stimulating cell renewal in the skin’s epidermis. Exfoliation and cell renewal brightens your complexion, creating a more youthful, vibrant glow.
Bakuchiol is a plant-derived natural retinol alternative (aka Vitamin A) for anti-aging. This ingredient reduces fine lines and wrinkles by plumping the skin and smoothing out rough skin texture.
Papaya Fruit Extract, also known as medicinal tree, is another powerful ingredient for skin brightening and wrinkle reduction. Papaya Fruit Extract also purifies the skin while providing antioxidant benefits and balancing the skin.
Lastly, Oat Bran Extract is a multi-benefit ingredient that protects the skin’s barrier function, helping to retain skin’s moisture as it soothes the skin and relieves it of any dryness.

Together, these ingredients are the cookbook to a fresher, renewed complexion, while providing anti-aging benefits.
To seal in these powerful ingredients and keep the skin hydrated, apply Method Nourish to finish your skincare routine. Our aestheticians also recommend using the Soothe & Hydrate Serum with hyaluronic acid to calm the skin while bathing it in hydration. The Active Rejuvenation Serum is also highly recommended, as it hydrates, softens and lifts the skin, for a more youthful and radiant complexion.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/the-game-plan-for-radiant-skin/,"Your skin’s condition can reveal a lot about you, like if you’re spending plenty of time outdoors or applying sunscreen as much as you say you do. If we’re being honest, we can be complacent and not always use the proper protection needed for our skin. Luckily, our skin produces melanin—the natural skin pigment that protects skin cells from UV rays. However, relying on melanin alone doesn’t give you the necessary protection. Without sunscreen and the proper care, you’ll start to see the skin imperfections you’ve been warned about.
Hyperpigmentation—irregular darkening of the skin—is a common skin issue caused by multiple factors. Excessive sun exposure is the #1 leading factor as it can result in sun damage. When unprotected skin is exposed to the sun, melanin production kicks into overdrive as it attempts to protect the skin from damaging UV rays. However, the overproduction of melanin is what causes skin discoloration and uneven skin tone. Hyperpigmentation also results from air pollution, scars, and hormonal changes. Sometimes laser procedures can cause unexpected pigmentation if not done properly.
So, what can we do now to help fade dark spots and achieve radiant, glowing skin? We can commit to protecting our skin moving forward by limiting sun exposure, applying sunscreen daily, and using the right skincare regimen to restore our skin.
Corrective Lightening Treatment by Dr. Lancer is a new, highly effective OTC product that helps gradually fade skin discoloration such as dark spots, age spots, and UV-induced hyperpigmentation, helping to revitalize skin’s radiance. Corrective Lightening Treatment doesn’t alter a person’s natural skin color. Its sole purpose is to reduce unwanted dark spots and discoloration to give a balanced, radiant complexion.
This powerful serum contains 2% Hydroquinone, Dr. Lancer’s #1 recommended ingredient to lighten unwanted pigmentation. The maximum hydroquinone concentration available without a prescription is 2% and is the key to fading dark spots. It’s the champion ingredient for skin tone correction, and Dr. Lancer has been using it to fade skin discoloration for years. When creating products, he uses the motto: Practice to Product. Everything used in the office is created as a product for patients to use at home. Corrective Lightenting Treatment also contains Niacinamide, also known as vitamin B3, which helps improve the look of skin texture, enlarged pores, and firmness.
With a handle on Corrective Lightening Treatment, we can use it as part of an overall skincare regimen to achieve radiant and healthy skin. But how do we find the right products for us? Dr. Lancer shares his secret—the Lancer Ancestry Scale to determine the right skincare routine for each patient.
In 1997, Dr. Lancer attended the American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery conference. During the conference, a panel of highly respected dermatologists spoke about poor outcomes from resurfacing techniques. A resident came forward, sharing a recent complication he had with a standard laser procedure. The patient seemed like an ideal candidate. Blue eyes, blonde hair, fair skin. The procedure should have been a success but instead resulted in a second-degree burn. The same procedure had gone as planned with other candidates. So, what was different this time?
During his return flight to Los Angeles, Dr. Lancer thought about this situation and left the airport with a couple of ideas. Reaching out to the resident again, he asked if he had seen the patient’s family during the consultation. The resident said he did and mentioned that the family had an olive skin tone, which differed from his patient’s fair skin. This new information sparked an idea and led to the creation of the Lancer Ancestry Scale.
Using the theory that skins outward appearance can be deceiving, Dr. Lancer posits that a procedure or skincare regimen shouldn’t be recommended solely based off what one sees on the surface. It’s important to know the global ancestry of each patient to provide the most appropriate skincare regimen. With multigenerational ancestral background information, Dr. Lancer can determine which products will perform best for each patient. A skincare routine developed with the guidance of the Lancer Ancestry Scale may be extremely useful if complexion uniformity is the main issue, particularly in individuals with sensitive skin.
With Corrective Lightening Treatment and skincare regimen determined by the Lancer Ancestry Scale, you’ll have the recipe needed to gradually fade dark spots and get glowing skin. Make sure to acclimate your skin slowly when starting any new product. Use a small amount on the affected area once or twice a week to start off. You can begin to use the product twice daily after a few applications.
With a plan in place, we can’t forget sunscreen to keep our skin tone balanced and healthy for life. Sunscreen is key even on overcast days. It’s important to note that all sources of light can influence skin toxicity, so remember that skin protection is needed during all waking hours. If you can see your surroundings without artificial light, there’s enough light to speed up skin aging.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/the-magic-of-younger-revealing-mask-intense/,"I bet you have a million masks at home, but there’s nothing quite like this one. Dr. Lancer’s Younger Revealing Mask Intense is the next generation treatment mask that provides a unique experience for consumers while revealing younger, more radiant skin. What makes this mask so different? Well, instead of washing off the mask, it is removed with a specifically designed silver magnetic wand that gently pulls the mask’s content from the skin, leaving behind active ingredients that help to reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles while accelerating cell turnover for younger-looking skin. The mask renews skin, working to improve the appearance of skin firmness and elasticity. Active ingredients also help to soften congested pores and re-regulate pore structure. This mask’s delivery system differs from any other mask and gives long-lasting anti-aging benefits for the face, neck, chest and body.
Dr. Lancer’s Younger Revealing Mask Intense comes with a set of 4 retinoid powered masks that contain a blend of Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Mineral Powder and Dimethicone. Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate is known to improve skin texture and tone while supporting collagen and cell turnover. Mineral powder is rich in iron and provides the source of ferromagnetic activity while Dimethicone provides emollience as it softens and moisturizes the skin. Younger Revealing Mask Intense comes with the magnetic wand and a small applicator to assist in the application process. Refills, as well as a trial size, are also available on LancerSkincare.com.
To apply the mask, use the applicator and spread the pod’s content evenly onto the face, neck and decollete. Dr. Lancer recommends leaving the mask on for 10-15 minutes, giving you just enough time to catch up on some emails or do a quick phone call with a friend. When it’s time to remove the mask, place the wand above the skins surface and watch as it gently lifts the mask off with its magnet, leaving those essential ingredients behind to work their magic. Remember, there’s no need to rinse since the magnetic wand removes the mask for you. Simply pat any residual product the tool may have missed into the skin. Pro-Tip! You can also wrap the magnetic wand with a tissue for less cleanup afterwards. The mask can be used once a week but patients may use it every other night if they wish.
As with all of our Advanced Treatments, it’s important to use the mask with the Lancer Method: Polish, Cleanse and Nourish to achieve the best results. The Younger Revealing Mask Intense is meant to be used within a system and is more effective when used with the Method.
Younger Revealing Mask intense is one of a kind, providing anti-aging benefits through a unique system. It’s exciting to see how it works from start to finish and we can’t wait for you to experience it for yourself.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/the-lancer-ancestry-scale-diving-deeper/,"The Lancer Ancestry Scale was developed by Dr. Lancer in 1998. The scale mirrored the well-known Thomas Fitzpatrick Classification Skin Typing System, which shows a person’s skin pigmentation in relation to their tolerance to sun exposure. At the time of the scale’s creation, Fitzpatrick was measuring the skin’s ability to tolerate UV rays to determine the correct dose of UVA to treat psoriasis. The scale lists six skin types including very fair, fair, light golden, olive, brown and dark brown.
After using the Fitzpatrick scale, Dr. Lancer created the Lancer Ancestry Scale to build on the concept by adding heritage into the equation. Lancer Ancestry Scale (LAS) was developed to help dermatological specialists clearly assess and understand the nature of the biologic function of each individual patient that they’re treating. In prior years, medical specialists used to determine skincare regimens and procedures based off of the patient’s skin color, hair color and eye color but what’s on the surface can be deceiving.
According to Dr. Lancer, you could have a blue eyed, blonde hair, fair complexion patient that looks like the ideal candidate for a laser or chemical peel treatment, but they may not be right for the treatment after all. A dermatologist needs to know the global origin of each patient in order to know if there are any hidden genes in the skin before deciding on the proper skincare regimen or procedure for an individual. For Instance, when Dr. Lancer sees a new patient, he always asks them to speak of their ancestry as far back as they know and most times he finds that the pigmentation in the patient’s skin is not an accurate reflection of their genetic ancestry. A patient could be carrying genes for a darker skin type, but those genes could be hidden in a porcelain complexion. Without knowing a patient’s ancestry, dermatologists could recommend treatments that could damage the skin rather than repair it. A person’s planetary origins influence skin response to topical therapy and can also influence healing time after various procedures.
Below is Dr. Lancer’s LAS scale which shows an ancestral background column with the appropriate LES Type.

To find a patient’s LES type, simply add up the numbers that correspond to their grandparents ethnicities and divide by four. The higher the number, the more likely they’ll experience complications with healing after a cosmetic procedure. It’s also important to note that they might experience an adverse reaction to aggressive resurfacing procedures, including laser treatments and chemical peels.

Having recently modified the scale’s title, we now look to it as: Ancestry According to Latitude and Longitude. Our global ancestry influences skin topical therapy as well as skin medical procedural therapy. For ancestral information, It’s not the name of the country of the patient that matters, it’s multi generation cumulative of what parts of the planet their family origins arise. If a patient’s multigenerational ancestry are closer to the Northern Hemisphere, chances are the skin is less likely to scar during a procedure than if it’s closer to the equatorial parts of the planet.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/how-to-care-for-congested-skin/,"On a daily basis, your skin is fighting against environmental pollutants, sweat, and pore-clogging makeup. And if you have oily or congested skin, it is already combating blockages in the pores from excess sebum and dead skin cells. Finding products that can effectively but gently clear skin’s buildup can be a difficult task. Even products that are labeled non-comedogenic, water-based, or oil-free might still have irritating ingredients that can exacerbate your skin condition. We recommend you use products that are customized to address your complexion’s particular needs, which is why Dr. Harold Lancer has drawn from his extensive experience as a world-class dermatologist to create the optimal routine targeted for oily skin.

Dr. Lancer has taken his revolutionary three-step skin care system, the Lancer Method, and formulated it specifically for oily skin. The Method: Oily-Congested targets pore congestion and minimizes oiliness while also nourishing your skin so it looks radiant and refreshed.
What Is Congested Skin?
Before you set out to eliminate all traces of oil or shine, you should know that everyone’s skin needs some level of oil. It can even be beneficial to your complexion. Without it, your skin would look dry and lose its smooth, soft texture. But when too much oil is produced, it can obstruct the pores and stimulate the growth of bacteria. Combine that excess oil with dead skin cells, makeup, pollution, and sweat, the pores become clogged. In this state, your skin will be prone to acne or blemishes and look dull and uneven.
It is important to realize that oily congested skin can be attributed to a number of factors such as genetics and hormones or lifestyle factors like stress, diet, sleep, and medication. Though certain aspects are out of your control, there are steps that you can take to help keep your oily skin under control.
Caring for Congested Skin
In order to return balance to your skin, it’s important to get to the root of the problem, which means clearing out your clogged pores. The best way to clean the surface of your skin and clear your pores is with a gentle exfoliant. The goal is to resurface the skin without over-drying it with harsh chemicals or irritating it with rough physical exfoliants. With the right polishing product, you can buff away environmental traces and surface oil, including dead skin, makeup, or other debris. An effective polishing product will offer physical and chemical exfoliation without abrasion, helping to clear your pores and fight off congestion while preparing the skin for cleansing. Your exfoliator should also be formulated with nourishing ingredients that hydrate your skin. Once your skin is prepped for moisture, it’s imperative to use a product that isn’t too heavy or thick but still provides superior hydration.
The Method: Oily-Congested
The Method: Oily-Congested addresses this specific skin type to produce a complexion that looks clean and healthy. Dr. Lancer formulated the 3-Step Lancer Method to accelerate speed cell turnover by removing dull, dry surface cells, which then prepares the skin for luxurious nurturing. The Method: Oily Congested regimen targets the most common issues by eliminating pore-clogging sebum and dead skin cells without over-drying areas to boost new skin cells for refreshed healthy-looking skin.
The Method: Oily-Congested helps keep skin free of congestion with carefully selected ingredients that polish, cleanse, and nourish without adding excess oil. Begin with The Method: Polish Oily-Congested which uses gentle mineral exfoliants and plant enzymes to retexturize skin’s surface and remove dead skin cells. It also incorporates BHA and lilac stem cells to refine the look of pores. The polish step sets in motion the process of rejuvenation at the cellular level.
Follow the polish step with The Method: Cleanse Oily-Congested. This energizing cleanser employs Jojoba beads and oil-minimizing extracts to remove remaining impurities without stripping skin of its natural moisture. BHA and tea tree oil slough off dead skin cells revealing smoother looking skin. These high quality ingredients provide potent cleaning power. Your skin is properly cleansed and prepared to absorb nutrients in the last step.
Oily, congested skin needs proper nourishment and hydration to look healthy and youthful. The Method: Nourish Oily-Congested is an ultra-light, non-greasy moisturizer that helps your skin strike the perfect balance. This moisturizer is formulated with sodium hyaluronate to offer essential hydration and anti-aging benefits while BHA and tea tree oil decongest skin’s pores. The infusion of rare grape polyphenol and nasturtium flower extract provides powerful antioxidants to protect the skin from environmental stressors. At the end of your 3-Step Lancer Method: Oily-Congested skin care routine, your complexion will have been polished, cleansed, and nourished without the harsh and irritating effects for a healthy Lancer glow.
The Best Way to Care for Oily Skin and Congested Skin
Blemished, irritated, congested skin can be transformed with the Lancer Method: Oily-Congested. Dr. Lancer developed this advanced system with highly effective ingredients to give you a beautiful complexion day after day with a simple three-step regimen. Try the Lancer Method: Oily-Congested products and put an end to your frustrating search for the right skin care products. You will feel and see a difference in your skin that you never thought possible.

Skin appears brittle from the visible rough patches and flakiness. Lines and wrinkles look more pronounced when your complexion is depleted of its plump and supple texture. Add in a tight, itchy feeling, and you’ve got the definition of dehydrated skin. In addition to that tight, dry feeling and the visible wrinkles and roughness, you may notice that your skin is oilier than usual. While that may seem counterintuitive, many of the same triggers for dehydrated skin also prompt excess oil production. The good news: If you take proper care of your skin, those symptoms of dehydration can disappear, and your complexion will be restored to its optimal healthy level.

How to Fix Dehydrated Skin
It is important to know that there is a difference between dryness and dehydration. Dry skin typically refers to skin experiencing unusual topical dryness, perhaps due to the weather or a new treatment. Dehydration, on the other hand, typically refers to skin showing the side effects of internal dehydration.
In this state, your skin is in a delicate condition, and it needs to be treated gently to resolve the issue. Just as there is a personally tailored skin care regimen to fit your needs, there are also specific lifestyle changes you can make to fix your dehydrated skin. They include abstaining from coffee and alcohol, both can dry out the skin, and eating a healthy diet rich in whole foods. And the most important is to drink plenty of water. Staying hydrated internally is essential for beautiful skin. Dr. Lancer advocates for healthy skin from a holistic approach so while you make adjustments to your lifestyle, you will also need to fine tune your skin care routine. Here are some guidelines for getting your complexion back on track:

Avoid harsh skin care products. This isn’t a time for rough exfoliating scrubs or cleansers that strip skin of moisture. Gentle products are best to help your skin look and feel hydrated and moisturized.
Skip the use of exfoliating brushes or tools. While these devices are popular for removing dead skin cells, they can also exacerbate rough, red, and dry skin.
Review your skin care routine. If you’ve recently added several different kinds of potent products such as retinol, acids, and vitamin C, they could be a cause of the dehydration. Try decreasing the frequency of use or alternating products to see if that helps your skin get back to normal and make sure you are using them according to the directions on the label.
Don’t wash your skin with hot water. Piping-hot water can make skin feel even more dehydrated. When washing your face, use lukewarm water instead.
Use a hydrating moisturizer. The Method: Nourish offers powerful hydration thanks to avocado and olive fruit oils that soothe and replenish, while hyaluronic acid and peptides help skin retain moisture. Make sure to use your moisturizer day and night for around-the-clock hydration. This step will restore your skin to look smooth and glowing again.
Supplement skin with antioxidants. In skin care, antioxidants help protect skin and neutralize free radicals while giving your complexion a renewed vitality, which can counteract the signs of dehydration. Dr. Lancer’s Omega Hydrating Oil is formulated with a rejuvenating blend of oils while omega fatty acids 3, 6, and 9 act as antioxidants to renew skin’s elasticity and suppleness.
Always use sunscreen. Without diligent application of sunscreen, the damaging effects of UV rays will counteract the healing action of the peptides, anti-oxidants and other ingredients used in your skin care. Sheer Fluid Sun Shield offers SPF 30 coverage, as well as anti-aging ingredients such as Gamay grape stem cells plus chamomile to soothe and calm skin.

If you are ever plagued with dehydrated skin, don’t panic—just use these smart and simple skin care and lifestyle strategies to keep skin hydrated and radiant.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/dr-lancers-secrets-for-being-red-carpet-ready/,"Awards season hasn’t yet started, but I am already working with my celebrity clientele to plan both long-term and last-minute treatments to keep them looking red-carpet ready, from head to toe, for the busy months ahead. If you have a major special event coming up, you can use these same skincare strategies for celebrity-level glowing, vibrant skin.

One of the most important things to remember is that achieving a radiant complexion is an ongoing process, combining daily maintenance with in-clinic treatments. The celebrities I work with know about the awards’ ceremonies, screenings and other events they will be attending months in advance, and as soon they have that information they will book an appointment with me in my Beverly Hills practice so we can work out a multi-phase treatment plan. Most often, my celebrity clientele wants plump, hydrated, glowing and wrinkle-free skin that looks flawless underneath makeup. You should follow this same template so your complexion will be at its glorious peak in time for your big event.
Long-Term Prep
The trend for long-term skin prep and maintenance is to implement minor tweaks here and there on a repetitive, regular schedule for a cumulative maximum result. Rather than just committing to one major treatment every six months, smaller treatments are spaced only weeks apart. You will have minimal downtime, compared to more intense treatments, and the work you have done will look more natural because it’s taking place gradually rather than as a sudden, dramatic change.
That last point is especially important because if facial work is visible, it means the procedure was performed with a lack of artistry and precision. Hollywood doesn’t want a trail of “who done it”—stars want the focus to be on their beautiful skin.
To achieve that, I recommend treatments that will generate firming of the protein/collagen matrix to keep skin bright, supple and youthful looking, as well as a mild melasma peel for any color correction. If needed, there can be additional, non-ablative laser work to reduce pore size and refine crepey skin texture.
I always advise my celebrity clients that they need to treat the skin all over their body, not just their face, especially with the latest trend in “dare to bare” red-carpet fashion featuring thigh-high slits, sheer dresses or plunging v-necks. Usually, celebrities come in every two to three weeks for a full-body, head-to-toe microbuffing to remove dead skin cells and rejuvenate the skin so it looks fresh and feels soft. We’ll also schedule out the number of treatments with the Secret RF laser for refining any areas of the skin, mindful of what parts may be exposed by potential fashion choices, such as the arms, elbows, knees or thighs. With the advent of mani-cams that offer up-close looks at manicures, rings and bracelets, hands should also be part of your treatment plan. Body facial protocols, or aesthetic skin treatments, will be applied throughout to complement the above treatments.
Last-Minute Treatments
Don’t wait until the final days immediately before your big event to get Botox or fillers. You need to get them done at least a week in advance, because it takes that long for those injectables to gain full efficacy and get acclimated into the body.
Instead, focus on skin firming and lifting all over the body, which can be done 12 to 48 hours before an event. In the office, I typically use the Venus Legacy with radio frequency because it gives the desired results and the only side effect is a light pinkness on the skin for some people, and that only lasts for about 20 minutes. This is especially helpful if there is an outfit change the morning of the event that requires a need for a different treatment than originally planned—for instance, a celebrity who was going to wear a gown with sleeves decides to switch to a strapless one that bares the arms. Quick, topical, noninvasive radiotherapy can firm the skin. I use the multiprobe Legacy generator that can be implemented on the arms, face, neck and breasts; sometimes, if you want to make the breast shape appear perkier, the Legacy can be used on the upper pole of the breast instead of double-sided tape.
The goal for my celebrity clients is to have them feeling confident and red carpet-and-camera-ready—and that should be your goal as well. If a celebrity patient asks me for a specific procedure and there isn’t enough downtime, I will direct them towards an alternate solution for the results they are looking for. Find a dermatologist who has this same level of expertise and experience in multiple forms of treatment who can help you—and your complexion—be the shining star at your next special event.
All-Over Glamour
This year’s Oscars ceremony features nominated actresses with a wide range of styles—the regal Glenn Close, the fashion-forward glam of Lady Gaga, the timelessly elegant Regina King, the youthful élan of Emma Stone. This means the Oscars red carpet will be a fashion showcase, with gowns that are sure to dazzle.
If you have picked out a special gown for a major event, you’ll want the skin all over your body to look its best, especially those areas that are highlighted by the cut of your dress. For instance, if you are wearing a deep, plunging V-neck or strapless top, the skin in the neck and bust areas should look smooth and bright. My Corrective Lightening Treatment is a highly effective neck and chest cream that can help with hyperpigmentation, dark spots, age spots and discoloration because it contains the maximum 2% Hydroquinone allowed without a prescription; the Hyaluronic Acid in it provides incredible moisturization for luscious-looking and hydrated skin.
Many evening outfits show off your décolleté, so you need a product such as my Contour Décolleté. This chest wrinkle cream helps to diminish the appearance of the lines that can make the skin here look crepey and dry. The skin in your bust area will look and feel firmer, with a smoother, renewed texture.
I always advise my celebrity clients to lavish attention on their skin everywhere, including the arms and legs. To create radiant flawless-looking skin, it is important to exfoliate away dead skin cells and then hydrate. The Method: Body Polish takes my legendary skincare system developed for the face and adapts it for body polishing. Dry and dull surface skin is buffed away to reveal luminosity and softness. Follow that with The Method: Body Cleanse, which uses sumptuous watermelon seed, marula oils and Kigelia fruit extract to clean and hydrate skin so it practically gleams. To maintain that glow, use The Method: Body Nourish, a glycolic body cream formulated for superior moisturizing that creates an improved tone and texture to the appearance of the skin.
Being red-carpet ready means your skin is vibrant from head to toe. By following the advice I give my star clients, you too will look resplendent at any event, with the brilliance that comes from beautiful skin.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-hyperpigmentation/,"I have many patients who come to me with hyperpigmentation, in which blotches of skin, usually on the face, turn darker than normal. For many people, this is a very distressing skin condition. They worry about the possible causes of hyperpigmentation, how it affects their overall appearance and whether it can be treated. However, I find that when patients understand what hyperpigmentation is, many of their concerns are allayed.
The Causes of Hyperpigmentation
Hyperpigmentation generally occurs with excessive melanin production in the body’s cells that are called melanocytes. Melanin gives the skin its color, and when there is too much melanin the skin can turn brown. Hyperpigmentation most often looks like a dark blotch on the skin, and it can vary in size from small to large. While hyperpigmentation is frequently seen on the face, it can also appear elsewhere on the body.
There are a few common causes for hyperpigmentation. One type of hyperpigmentation that women experience is melasma, which is due to hormonal changes that can happen during pregnancy, and sometimes with the use of birth control pills. The melasma spots often are seen on prominent areas of the face such as the forehead, cheeks and chin.
Another frequent cause of hyperpigmentation that I see in patients is prolonged sun exposure that takes place over many years. This can result in liver spots on the hands, age spots on the face or freckles that have grown darker on the arms, chest or other body parts that have seen too much sun. This exposure to harmful UV rays from the sun can also worsen melasma.
One of the most important points to note is that hyperpigmentation is harmless in most cases. A highly qualified and experienced dermatologist can diagnose hyperpigmentation with a physical exam and determine if there is a need for testing for any underlying medical condition. This may include taking a small sample of the skin for a biopsy.
A dermatologist can also discuss appropriate prevention or treatment options with a patient, which may include sunscreen, lasers, chemical peels or creams that contain hydroquinone or tretinoin, which are skin brighteners that may help fade these dark patches. In some cases, hyperpigmentation spots may fade on their own, but it is always advisable to see a dermatologist for an exam to rule out any medical conditions.
Hyperpigmentation can dramatically impact someone’s appearance, but with a consultation with your dermatologist and appropriate treatment, it often can be satisfactorily resolved.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/retinol-younger-looking-skin/,"We tend to ask a lot from our anti-aging skin-care products. We want to minimize the look of wrinkles and fine lines, reduce the appearance of pores and create a smoother texture on the surface of our skin. We want a supple and firm looking complexion. If it seems impossible for one ingredient to work wonders on all these skin issues, then you haven’t tried retinol. This vitamin A derivative is famed for its anti-aging properties, and because it’s being incorporated into many kinds of products, it’s easier than ever to make retinol the star of your skin care regimen.
How to Use Retinol
The ideal retinol treatment should be powerful enough so that you see noticeable results, but formulated with other key ingredients that support your skin’s appearance and offer complementary benefits.  Advanced Retinol Treatment by Lancer® Skincare contains a potent 1.25% retinol (the highest concentration of retinol currently on the market is 2%) and the proprietary CoRetinol Technology. Plus, there is the plant-derived Bakuchiol, which mimics the effects of retinol for added effectiveness. The Advanced Retinol Treatment also features antioxidants to nurture your complexion as well as collagen and prickly pear extract to hydrate the surface of the skin. Your complexion will feel smooth and toned, and the appearance of lines will be diminished—you will look and feel renewed.
This is a powerhouse night serum with retinol—evening products are always preferable to use because retinol calls for limited sun exposure and you should always wear protective clothing and sunscreen. When applying this retinol night serum, a little goes a long way—just gently massage one to two pumps of Advanced Retinol Treatment to dry, clean skin. If you’re new to retinol, or if you experience mild redness or irritation, limit use to every other night as your skin adjusts to the product. When storing your retinol treatment, keep it away from light as that can cause the ingredient to lose its potency.
With consistent, regular use, retinol can improve the appearance of your skin. Your complexion will look recharged with a lit-from-within luster, and skin issues such as dry patches, uneven tone, clogged pores and fine lines will appear to be minimized. With all these incredible benefits, it’s easy to see why retinol should be a must-have for gorgeous, glowing skin.

All you need to complete the picture are your glow-to beauty essentials that will keep your skin looking flawless on the go. Make sure to have these beauty and skin-care products packed before you take off for your three-day weekend:

Sunscreen
Chances are you want to soak up the last official weekend of summer, so you’ll be spending plenty of time outdoors. Lancer Sheer Fluid Sun Shield offers broad-spectrum SPF 30 coverage, as well ingredients such as Gamay Grape Stem Cells and Chamomile Extract for a radiant, dewy look. Plus, its lightweight consistency is perfect for hot weather.

Nighttime retinol
After a day outdoors, treat your skin right with the anti-aging power of retinol. Lancer Advanced Retinol Treatment is a potent skin rejuvenator, working to diminish the look of lines and its exfoliating properties help improve the appearance of skin texture. Wake up looking refreshed and relaxed—which is perfect, since you are on vacation after all.

Travel-sized skin care
Whether you’re flying to your destination or simply don’t want full-size bottles taking up space in your suitcase, The Method Travel Collection for Face allows you to take your favorite skincare essentials with you wherever you go. The set contains The Method: Polish, The Method: Cleanse, The Method: Nourish and Eye Contour Lifting Cream with Diamond Powder.

Create a Natural, No-Fuss Face
When you’re posting selfies from your travels on Instagram, you’ll want to capture that effortless “no-makeup makeup look”. It’s easy to achieve this look with just a few necessities—and relaxing on vacation will just add to your blissed-out glow.
Primer. Most primers just act like a spackle to fill in lines on your face. Lancer’s Studio Filter Pore Perfecting Primer goes above and beyond, not just creating a smooth looking complexion with optical diffusers and a universal skin tint but also helping improve the look of pores and your skin’s texture with ingredients such as Porifin Complex and Acmella Oleracea Extract.
Concealer. If your vacation plans include some late nights out on the town, a concealer can make you look as if you had a full night’s sleep. Lancer’s Studio Light Flawless Eye Concealer glides on smoothly for easy blendability, and the soft-focus filters and amino acid complex with caffeine can perk up even the most tired eyes.
Lip treatment. Enhance your beautiful smile for vacation selfies with the Volume Enhancing Lip Serum. Your lips will look lush, plump and well-hydrated, and any lip lines you have will seem to have been blurred away. The glossy sheen will give your lips that extra pop of natural radiance that will keep you camera ready.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/sleep-your-way-to-healthier-looking-skin/,"Waking up to beautiful-looking skin is not a dream. Adequate sleep is vital for skin health. It’s a dynamic time when your body and mind rebalance. Sleep loss can lead to dull-looking skin, dark circles under the eyes, and eventually fine lines. Knowing the body repairs itself and builds up energy for the next day during deep sleep, that’s why I am such a strong advocate of the importance of quality sleep. It’s essential if you want to wake up looking and feeling refreshed.

In addition to ensuring your body receives restful sleep to achieve your dream skin, it is important to follow a regular skincare regimen using quality products. After being out and about all day, your skin needs to be cleansed and moisturized with quality skincare products to help maintain its youthful appearance. You can also do your part to promote healthy-looking skin with a high-performance night treatment. A quality, facial cream designed for use at night, can help replenish skin that needs an extra boost of hydration.
Investing in a high-quality night cream to use all year around means you can steep skin in moisture while you sleep so you are hydrated and glowing when you wake. When I formulated my line of advanced, targeted treatments, I did it to further enhance the results of The Method, my signature three-step regimen of Polish, Cleanse and Nourish. With Intensive Night Treatment, you can go to sleep knowing you are providing your skin with the essential fatty acids and antioxidants that help it retain moisture and look younger. The fact that it’s a nighttime product means it is designed to be applied during the hours of sleep, when the body is most open to receiving skincare benefits.
At the heart of the formula, this luxurious anti-aging cream is developed with skin beneficial hydrating agents including Hylaplex™ and Maruala Oil which provide a moisture barrier, helping skin retain healthy hydration for a smoother, plumper appearance and renewed radiance. It also helps hydrate skin to improve the appearance of wrinkles.
Sleep does wonders for us, and beauty sleep is not just a concept. Getting your beauty sleep will help you achieve that all-over luminescence we all desire. Once you are on a good sleep schedule, you will be surprised to see the difference in your life – mentally, emotionally and physically.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/from-practice-to-product/,"Introducing Lancer Omega Hydrating Oil with Ferment Complex
As a practicing dermatologist and head of Lancer Skincare, my product innovations are informed by my own clinical observations and wider industry need. Recently, I have observed an increase in skin dehydration caused by stressful lifestyles and poor nutrition. My latest innovation, Omega Hydrating Oil with Ferment Complex was developed in response to a widespread need for advanced skin hydration and moisturization.

Moisturization and hydration are unique effects and not interchangeable. Hydration refers to attracting water content to your skin, making it look plump, smooth and bouncy. Moisturization is more about helping the skin to lock in hydration and reducing the appearance of the effects of environmental stressors. When the delicate barrier that protects the surface of the skin is not adequately hydrated or moisturized, it experiences water loss, leading to dry, flaky skin.
I developed Omega Hydrating Oil, a blend of 10% fermented oils rich in omega fatty acids, polyphenols, and antioxidants which helps to saturate the uppermost layer of skin with intense hydration to help soften the skin, promoting a healthy-looking, supremely moisturized complexion.
100% Water-Free Formula

Most facial oils are formulated either with pure oils that only provide moisturizing benefits or are emulsions that incorporate water to topically address hydration. Omega Hydrating Oil delivers both essential hydration and moisture in a water-free formula. Instead of water, it is formulated with a Smart Hydrator Molecule that helps to provide effective hydration.  With 10% Ferment Complex, this nourishing blend of fermented oils including Argan, Olive, Shiunko, and Licorice helps lock in moisture, softening the look of fine lines and leaving the skin with a dewy glow.  Packed with Omega Fatty Acids 3, 6 and 9, the advanced formula absorbs quickly, improving the appearance of skin elasticity and suppleness.  Turmeric helps to minimize redness and works together with Chlorophyllin-Copper Complex to help refine the look of pores and improve the appearance of skin texture. Best of all, Omega Hydrating Oil is a silky, fast-absorbing treatment that leaves a non-greasy finish, making it perfect for all skin types.
If you are wary of applying an oil directly to your skin, I recommend mixing a couple drops of Omega Hydrating Oil with The Method: Nourish or your current moisturizer. This will allow you to introduce the oil to your skincare regimen while you adjust to the concept of oil-based skincare. Whether applied directly to your skin or mixed with your moisturizer as prep for a flawless makeup application, the Omega Hydrating Oil will help deliver beautiful, hydrated skin for that famous Lancer Glow.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/red-carpet-ready/,"Awards season is upon us. The Golden Globes marks the first large red carpet event of the season and puts the spotlight on popular beauty trends for 2018. A radiant complexion will never go out of style and looking red carpet ready shouldn’t be a celebrity exclusive. That’s why I want to share some of my most practical tips that I personally apply and share with my celebrity clientele for skin that glows from within.

The first step to having red carpet ready skin is to take a good look at yourself in the mirror and focus on one aspect (from head to toe) that will make the biggest improvement to your look and your confidence.
In the run up to a big event like the Golden Globes, it’s always best to remain committed to your regimen. Now is not the time to cut corners and all of my patients know to stick with their daily skincare routine.
Hydration is essential for younger and more radiant looking skin. To ensure your skin maintains a smooth and plump appearance you need to approach hydration both inside and out. Drink plenty of water and apply a sheet mask, the trick that celebrities have been using for years. It is one of the best ways to prep for special appearances to ensure that your skin looks hydrated and is at its glowing best.
Don’t forget the importance of maintaining fresh, smooth skin around the eyes along with beautifully conditioned lips.  A quality eye cream helps improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Paired with a good concealer, you’re able to disguise dark circles for brighter looking eyes. Highlight your lips by using a clear or sheer lip gloss for lips that look smooth while adding a glossy sheen that complements your natural lip color.
A healthy lifestyle that combines exercise, the right nutrition and high-quality skincare is essential for great skin. Take a 30 minute walk.  Not only will you get your body moving, you will also help ease your mind. Making adjustments to your diet like giving up added salt, dairy and caffeine will also support your quest for award winning skin.  For that extra special occasion, pampering your skin with a facial or relaxing at home treatment will do wonders.  Treat yourself! It’s important and will help you look your glowing best for any event.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/skin-polishing-ideal-oily-skin-treatment/,"People with oily skin often feel like there’s no way to reduce excess oil and blemish-causing bacteria without irritating the skin. However, skin polishing is an ideal oily skin treatment. When you polish your skin, you remove surface layers of dirt, makeup, and pollutants that can clog your pores and irritate your skin, while scrubbing away excess oil and sebum that further exacerbate blemishes. When you remove this surface debris, you reveal skin that’s smoother and younger looking. Your own beautiful skin shines through, without the pore-clogging buildup that can dull your radiance.

What Makes Skin Oily?
Is it the pizza you ate yesterday or the fight you had with your mother? Maybe it’s your hormone cycle. In truth, oily skin can be caused by a variety of factors, so while certain aspects may be out of your control, you can still keep your oily skin from getting out of control. Most oily skin is inherited, and your family members probably experience the same oily skin patterns you do. As frustrating as genetics can be, you can take steps to help keep oil under control. Stress, hormones, irritation, environmental factors, and overly harsh skincare can all influence the severity of your skin’s oiliness. Pay attention to your health and take care of your skin with the right skincare and oily skin treatment, and you can keep your oil under control.
After you’ve worked hard to lower your stress level, eat a clean diet, and identify hormonal triggers, you may still notice your skin is quite oily. Take a look at your skincare. The wrong skincare can make oily skin worse, so it’s vital to avoid skincare that will aggravate it. First, avoid harsh soaps and cleansers that leave your skin feeling dry and tight. Cleansers that strip your skin of natural oils cause overproduction of oil and create more pore-clogging sebum. Also avoid alcohol-based toners and treatments. Alcohol dehydrates the skin and, once dried out, your skin fights back with extra oil production. It’s important not to skip moisturizer in the hopes that it will reduce the sheen and breakouts. Even oily skin needs nourishing hydration, and since oily skin treatments can dry skin out a bit, moisturizer is particularly important for balance. Finally, beware of overly abrasive exfoliators that irritate your skin and cause abrasions, overproduction of oil and sebum, and make skin more prone to breakouts. Any product that polishes or offers chemical exfoliation should be gentle enough to remove surface debris without irritation.
How to Find the Right Oily Skin Treatment
Once you’ve discovered how to avoid making your oily skin worse, it’s time to help  improve your oily or congested skin. Whether you’re searching for an oily skin treatment to keep the oil at bay or you’re seeking the best acne treatment for oily skin, you’ll need to find the right balance in your skincare products. Pay close attention to both your daily skincare and advanced treatment products to make sure you’re caring for your oily skin properly.
You may be surprised that skin polishing is such an effective way to combat oily skin. When you eliminate the buildup of dead skin cells, sebum, dirt, makeup, and other grime on the surface of your skin, you help minimize impurities that clog your pores while helping to clear existing congestion.  This reduces the likelihood of new blemishes forming while helping to clear up existing breakouts. As long as your polishing product is gentle and thorough, skin polishing is the ideal oily skin treatment. You’ll reveal smoother, healthier, younger looking skin that stays clear longer. By eliminating the dead surface cells, you will also ensure that the products you apply are delivered directly to the skins surface to help keep oiliness and breakouts at bay. Use a daily polishing treatment plus a periodic advanced treatment for best results. The combination of physical exfoliators and gentle chemical exfoliators polishes away dull skin without irritation for a radiant complexion.
Lancer Skincare Understands How to Treat Oily Skin
Oily skin does come with some benefits. Oily skin doesn’t show the signs of aging as quickly, so your skincare should help minimize excess oil without sapping every ounce of moisture. With Lancer Skincare, you can care for oily and congested skin while making the most of your skin’s natural radiance, without finding your face slicked with oil by the day’s end. We’ve changed the name of this line from “Blemish Control” to “Oily/Congested” because you still need the right products for oily skin even though it may be blemish-free.  This line was formulated specifically to meet the needs of oily skin, to ensure that your skin enjoys the benefits of its natural oils without the excesses.
Use The Lancer Method daily for the ideal oily skin treatment. The Method: Polish Oily/Congested is the first step in the regimen, incorporating natural mineral exfoliants like quartz and sodium bicarbonate to polish without abrading. Pumpkin and pomegranate enzymes gently slough dead skin and surface debris so the salicylic acid in the formula can help clear pore congestion. After polishing, use The Method: Cleanse Oily/Congested and The Method: Nourish Oily/Congested to remove impurities from the skin’s surface and imbue skin with nourishing moisture while fighting excess oil and congestion with salicylic acid. Minimize oil, fight breakouts, and help skin retain its natural radiance with The Method: Oily/Congested.
For additional oily and congested skin needs, our advanced treatments reveal the younger, healthier complexion hiding beneath dull, discolored layers of skin. Our Retexturizing Treatment offers dramatic exfoliation, improved hydration and environmental protection to avoid irritation, while our powerful polishing solution, Caviar Lime Acid Peel brightens and resurfaces for a renewed, fresher appearance and smoother, baby-soft skin. Because these products contain retinol, fruit extracts, and 10% glycolic acid, oily skin is gently but deeply exfoliated, helping to minimize fine lines and wrinkles and even the appearance of skin’s tone and texture.
Try the Best Collection for Oily Skin

Whether you have oily skin or you also experience congested skin, we can help you look your best. Even if you can’t eliminate stress from your life or change your genetics, you can treat your skin to luxurious, effective oily skin products. Our carefully formulated skincare treats oily skin without irritating or overdrying. Enjoy the benefits of your oily skin without the oil slicks or breakouts. Use our oily skin products consistently in conjunction with the rest of The Lancer Method and watch your skin become healthier-looking and more radiant for more even appearance.
Why Skin Polishing is an Ideal Oily Skin Treatment was last modified:  March 30th, 2021 by Dr. Harold Lancer",Why Skin Polishing is an Ideal Oily Skin Treatment,
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/dietary-dos-and-donts-for-great-skin/,"Maintaining a healthy diet affects your skin just as much as what you use to take care of it. To help you make the most of your anti-aging skincare lifestyle, here are Dr. Lancer’s dietary dos and don’ts that can either complement or counteract your skincare strategies.

Here are a few things Dr. Lancer recommends you should be doing in order to make the most of your skincare:
Dietary Dos



Eat organic produce. Conventionally raised foods often contain hormones, antiobiotics, and pesticides that can disrupt your hormones or cause your body to react due to not recognizing the “cides.” Eat organic produce in abundance, especially when the produce is local and seasonal.


Eat more vegetables. While organic fruit is better than conventional options, be mindful of its sugar content, since sugar can contribute to acne breakouts and can inhibit your anti-aging products to work at their full potential. As vegetables are lower in sugar content, you can consume as many vegetables as you please.


Eat organically-raised meat and poultry. When you do indulge in meat and poultry, choose organically-raised sources in order to avoid growth hormones, steroids, and antibiotics.


Drink plenty of water every day. We suggest 13 cups per day for men and 9 cups for women daily, but be mindful of your water intake, especially if you exercise and sweat or live in a hot, humid environment.


Here are a few things Dr. Lancer recommends you should not be doing:
Dietary Don’ts



Cut back on dairy. For those who can’t completely give up their favorite dairy products, cut back and only consume organic dairy products to avoid hormones. However, experiment and try new alternatives. There have been major advances in creating tasty dairy alternative, such as creamy cashew milk with only 30 calories per serving in some cases.


Cut back on sugar. Most Americans consume too much sugar according to numerous reports, including the USDA. Sugar can trigger hormonal shifts in the body and intensify glycation, which can lead to a poor complexion and the breakdown of collagen.


Avoid wheat and gluten. The gluten-free movement has picked up a lot of followers in recent years, and while few people have Celiac Disease, a new study has shown that 40% of adults have some form of gluten or wheat sensitivity or intolerance. The Department of Health and Human Services points out that gluten sensitivity is still under investigation, but many researchers have found that a sensitivity to gluten could be causing one to be acne-prone, rosacea-prone, or have sensitive skin.


Avoid salt. Too much salt causes you to retain water, causing you to not be able to flush out toxins. Salt can also irritate the lining of your pores, which also leads to inhibiting toxins from being flushed from your body, as well as exacerbating acne. Instead of salt, there are a number of spices, such as cayenne or turmeric, are both good for you and give you a kick.


Distinguish between good fats and bad fats to enhance your skincare regimen. Not all fats are created equally. The Dietary Guideline for Americans recommends 25-35 percent of our diet should consist of healthy fats, which includes polyunsaturated fats (vegetable oils, fatty fish, nuts, and seeds), unsaturated fats (seafood, olive oil, and nuts), monounsaturated fats (avocados, peanut oil, and canola oil), and Omega-3 fatty acids (tuna, salmon, mackerel, sardines, etc.).Avoid these two types of fats: Saturated fat found in dairy products, red meat, and some plant products like palm oil. Trans fats is the second, which are added to a number of pre-packaged foods to preserve them, so check all labels. Dry skin is often caused by a lack of good fatty acids according to the National Institute of Health, so this is one dietary change that will make a big difference.


Skip fried foods. Not only are fried foods brimming with bad fats that fill you up so you don’t seek out good fats, the oil they are fried in becomes oxidized, which impacts protection against free radicals and oxidative stress. Fried foods can also contribute to high cholesterol, diabetes, and heart disease. There are many healthier versions, often baked, that allow you to indulge in your cravings while protecting your skin.


Avoid yeast. Many breads and baked goods contain Candida, a type of yeast, and can lead to glycation so skin appears to age faster and lose its plumpness. The CDC reports that there are 20+ types of Candida yeast naturally in the human body, and it can easily spread through the body particularly through your diet. This can lead to rashes, breakouts, and dry skin.


Withdraw from caffeine. Caffeine, which is often mixed with dairy in chocolate or a latte, dehydrates you and can ultimately lead to a “toxic overload” that wreaks havoc on your skin. Caffeine triggers your stress hormone, cortisol, to go into overdrive, causing you to feel as if you’re in a stressed-out state. This stress appears on your skin, causing a dull complexion, accelerating the aging process, and creating fine lines and wrinkles from lack of hydration.


Stay away from artificial sweeteners. While they might save you a few calories, it’s at the expense of your complexion. Insulin resistance can exacerbate acne, and although sweeteners aren’t really “sweet,” you’re tricking your brain into thinking you’re consuming sugar. It may not cause negative skin reactions in everyone, but if you depend on artificial sweeteners to get your fix but suffer from complexion problems, it’s worth experimenting to see if stopping the sweeteners will stop your complexion woes.


Limit your alcohol intake. Alcohol dulls your complexion due to causing dehydration. Overindulgence may also cause acne flare-ups as well as facial flushing or red, spidery veins that will be difficult to fade. For every drink you have, drink one glass of water to ensure that you stay hydrated.


In order to make the most of your anti-aging skincare, follow an anti-aging lifestyle to the best of your abilities. It’s okay to indulge in a slice of cake, pizza, or cheeseburger every now and again, but just be sure to keep everything in moderation. Sticking to an anti-aging eating strategy allows you to engage in the anti-aging lifestyle full-circle—from the outside with your skincare routine, and the inside with your diet.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/acne-self-care-at-home/,"Acne Self-Care at Home
Acne can occur at any age due to clogged pores, hormonal shifts, stress, genetics, diet, and even medication. There are also daily habits, such as not washing your face every day, talking on your cellphone without cleaning the screen, and touching your face that will also cause acne.

Fortunately, there are many at-home, self-care options that are easy to keep in mind to avoid acne flare ups. Here are a few habits you can easily integrate into your lifestyle to prevent acne:
Don’t pick at the blemish or pimple. 
This may be easier said than done, since extracting the whitehead or blackhead allows you to think that you are cleaning the pore and reducing its size. However, this picking and popping rarely ends well, especially when the bacteria on your fingers becomes implanted into the blemish, which is very common when squeezing and picking at acne, and will spread bacteria and cause more acne to break out. Remember that picking the blemish actually breaks the skin’s protective layer. If you truly cannot stand a whitehead or blackhead, see your aesthetician who can cleanly and expertly “leak” whiteheads and deeply cleanse pores. That is one acne-fighting process that should never be attempted at home. Acne is temporary, but scarring from squeezing and picking can be forever.

Not washing your pillowcases and other items enough. 
Your face is most commonly exposed to your pillowcase every day, which absorbs sweat and oil as you sleep. You may also wear the occasional hat, sweatband, or scarf, which can touch your face and also absorb oil and sweat throughout the day. CNN recommends washing your pillows (not pillowcases) every three to six months to tackle the 16 types of fungi that regular nest there with you. Pillowcases can be washed at least once per week with an all-natural, fragrance-free detergent to avoid any ingredients that may trigger break outs. Wash pillows in hot water on a gentle cycle, rinse twice, then dry with two tennis balls.
A good, gentle, natural cleaning is a must for any product that touches your face, whether it’s clothing, towels, or a couch you like to nap on. Remember that what touches your face can and will linger on your skin. To see how much your skin is truly exposed to potential acne triggers, keep a journal for one day of everything your face touches. When’s the last time you cleaned your yoga mat or your favorite hat? All of these items, if not properly cleaned, can cause acne, so be mindful about how often you clean them.

Limit your caffeine intake. 
Caffeine launches your body into a stressed-out state, which causes acne. Try to find other energy sources, such as changing your diet to one rich in complex carbohydrates, organic vegetables, and lean protein. Make sure to also avoid sugar, salt, or dairy, as these ingredients have been linked to causing acne due to their tendency to cause dehydration, which then leads to clogged pores that cannot release the toxins these ingredients put into the body.
Clean your cellphone. 
Acne Self-Care at Home
Your phone generally collects bacteria from your hands, and then transfers that bacteria simply through holding the phone to your face. Clean your phone with an alcohol wipe or hand sanitizer daily; in fact, you can also apply this tip to your sunglasses and eyeglasses as well!

Consistently follow a regimen designed for acne-prone skin. 
Focusing on certain ingredients used in your skincare regimen is also important, as you could be using ingredients that actually aggravate your skin and acne. Salicylic acid helps keep pores clear of clogging dirt, debris and sebum. Also look for glycolic acid and lactic acid, which help to remove dead surface skin cells. Because they are chemical exfoliants, continual use may lessen the appearance of acne scars. Just be sure to introduce these ingredients slowly into your skincare routine, as skin can become irritated with too many products being used on it.
If you’re looking for a skincare regimen, The Method: Blemish Control is a simple 3-step process that helps reduce and prevent blemishes while polishing, cleansing, and nourishing skin, giving you skin that glows while keeping breakouts under control. The Method: Blemish Control contains salicylic acid, which helps remove dead skin cells, while also paired with natural ingredients like pumpkin and pomegranate extract to reinforce sloughing off dead surface cells and lilac stem cell compound which has anti-blemish and oil-absorbing benefits to allow skin to be balanced and radiant.
Pick the right sunscreen for your skin.
Acne Self-Care at Home
All skin types need daily UVA/UVB protection. Find sunscreen that is lightweight and breathable, such as Sheer Fluid Sun Shield SPF 30 which is great for oily skin and never greasy-feeling; plus, it’s a wonderful makeup primer, too!
We hope that by integrating these tips and keeping your skincare ingredients in mind, you’ll be able to create the blemish control, homecare skincare routine that works for you.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/benefits-of-exercise-for-your-skin/,"Benefits of Exercise for your Skin
Working out is key to physical health, a fit body, mental clarity, and self-love. And while working out may thought of as something to keep in shape and feel healthier, it also provides numerous benefits for your skin. Your skin is exposed to free radicals in the air, sun exposure, and makeup can that clog your pores to the point of damaging your skin via acne or dullness. An increased heart rate and sweating naturally open your pores and release toxins, while also increasing blood flow to improve circulation and the delivery of more nutrients throughout your body.
The benefits of exercise, however, can be detrimental to your complexion if you don’t also prepare your body and your skin for your exercise session. While you may think working out with makeup on is okay, it really isn’t—makeup clogs your pores once it mixes with your sweat and oil, so be sure to remove makeup before you work out. Lancer Makeup Removing Wipes are individually packaged and can perfectly fit into your purse or gym bag. And once you’re done with your workout, make sure to shower off and wash your face using The Lancer Method. It may be tempting to simply wipe down your face or splash water on it after your workout, but you’re actually allowing toxins, sweat, and perhaps residual hair products to sit on your skin. The Lancer Method works perfectly for the shower, since The Method: Polish can thoroughly be cleansed off with the first rinse, while The Method: Cleanse can rid skin of lingering exfoliation debris and dead skin cells. We also provide the Lancer Method in travel sizes in case you want to use them immediately after your workout.
Workouts for Your Face

Just like you can target specific body parts, such as the glutes with donkey kicks, you can also target the skin with special workouts. Celebrity trainer Dalton Wong was featured in The Telegraph discussing his methods for “working out the face.” By increasing lean muscle mass and building up muscle, you can reverse some signs of aging in the face according to Wong. Lean muscle mass is directly beneath facial skin, and toning it via resistance training can make it appear plumper.
You may have also heard of “face yoga,” and while it can look silly, some experts swear by the results. Time Magazine reports that it can tighten and tone by focusing on critical facial muscles and learning strategies to prevent wrinkling. Poses similar to Lion’s Breath, making a fish face, directed eye movements, and raising your eyebrows may all help your face look more youthful.
Turn Up the Heat for Gorgeous Skin
If you prefer to exercise in the great outdoors, especially if you’re on vacation in paradise, some extra measures are required. Sun exposure can damage and age the skin no matter how intense it is, but direct heat and being closer to the equator (common traits of many vacation spots) can be even more damaging. Use Sheer Fluid Sun Shield SPF 30 any time you are exposed to the sun, and re-apply liberally every two hours.
What’s the Best Workout for Your Skin?
While you may think that you need to work up a sweat and feel sore the next day to achieve the benefits of exercise, you actually don’t. Exercise feels more beneficial when you actually enjoy what you are doing. If you don’t have a lot of time, then you may want to find an activity that fits into your schedule; for example, shoveling snow for 15 minutes is equivalent to walking for 2 miles in 30 minutes! If your aim is to burn fat, you will want a long, slow workout since that is the most effective.
It may seem strange, but while exercising relieves mental stress, you are engaging in physically stressing your body out. Strenuous exercise triggers the same hormonal cascade as stress does, causing your body to produce more free radicals when you exert yourself, which causes your skin to age. To avoid the stressful state of exercise, be aware of your limits. Exercises like brisk walks, yoga, Pilates, stretching, and reasonable weight resistance training are good for the skin because they increase circulation but do not push metabolism to an extreme that produces stress. But again, that doesn’t mean that you can’t engage in more strenuous activity like mountain climbing or kickboxing—just be aware of your body’s limits, and allow your body to rest and recover by engaging in lower-stress activities if you feel like being active every day.

Exercise allows your skin an energetic rush as it rids itself of toxins, becomes toned, and has a healthy, natural post-workout glow. After you exercise, be sure to replenish yourself with plenty of water, and then provide your skin with its own drink of anti-aging ingredients through the thorough polishing, cleansing, and nourishing power of The Lancer Method.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/how-to-layer-your-skincare/,"How to Layer Your Skincare
Dr. Harold Lancer has helped many clients by sharing some of his coveted tips on how to most effectively layer skincare product. Layering skincare products properly allows each product to deliver maximum benefits to the skin. If you find you have been using a skincare product and are not seeing the results you were expecting, chances are you may have applied your products in the wrong order.  Once you determine which products are best for your skin, layering your products correctly—from thinnest to thickest—will provide the ideal results. Lancer Skincare offers a variety of options for customizing your skincare routine.
One of the biggest misconceptions in skincare is that cleansing comes first. After studying skin’s regenerative cycle, Dr. Lancer created The Lancer Method, the 3-step system consisting of polishing (exfoliating), cleansing, and nourishing (moisturizing) the skin to achieve a deep clean while helping your skin look glowing and healthy. By “polishing” your skin before you cleanse, you remove dead skin cells and other surface debris, allowing the Cleanse and Nourish products to perform better.
How to Layer Your Skincare
After polishing skin and following with The Method: Cleanse to ensure a clean, prepped surface to begin treatment and hydration application, Dr. Lancer recommends applying the thinnest product first, which will generally be an anti-aging serum or lightweight gel. Allow this to fully absorb into the skin before applying heavier products like creams and moisturizers. However, if you’re using topical acne treatments, apply them to clean, dry skin before anything else for maximum benefit.
Treatment creams like Advanced C Radiance Treatment and Eye Contour Lifting Cream should be applied next to receive the full benefits, followed by your moisturizer. Moisturizers, such as The Method: Nourish, boost hydration with nurturing oils to improve your skin’s appearance.
How to Layer Your Skincare
The final layer in your skincare routine is sun protection. These necessary skincare products, such as Sheer Fluid Sun Shield SPF 30, are an essential step in assuring your skin has the best protection from damaging UV rays. After you’ve applied sun protection, your face is ready for the day or, if you choose, for makeup application. A proper skincare routine provides the perfect canvas for smooth, beautiful makeup.
Your Evening Skincare Regimen

A consistent nightly skincare routine supports your skin’s recovery, helping it appear younger and healthier. To receive the greatest benefits from your products, Dr. Lancer suggests the same layering of your nighttime skincare, from thinnest to thickest. While sunscreen isn’t necessary at night, you may want a night moisturizer with more hydration or an alternate nighttime treatment.
First, remove your makeup by gently wiping your face with Makeup Removing Wipes. Next, exfoliate your skin using any The Method: Polish (if you already polished in the morning, proceed to the cleanse step). Follow your Polish with The Method: Cleanse and pat your face dry with a clean towel, applying any acne treatments first, followed by liquids or serums. Nighttime is an optimal time to use a serum with active ingredients like Fade Serum Intense,   or for drier skin a more hydrating product such as Intensive Night Treatment to give skin an extra boost of long-lasting moisture and anti-aging nutrients.  Whatever your choice, finish off with The Method: Nourish.
When you layer your skincare products in the proper order, you’ll notice the difference in your skin’s texture and tone as it absorbs the anti-aging nutrients and antioxidants provided by your skincare. Everyone’s skin has different needs, so customize your Lancer Skincare products to make your unique skin look its best!

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/tips-for-skincare-while-traveling/,"Glowing On the Go: Tips for Skincare While Traveling
These recommendations from Dr. Lancer will minimize the effects of travel stress on your skin.
Stick to your routine.
When you travel, your daily routine might be unpredictable. Whether you are in all-day meetings in a conference room or hiking in Kauai, maintaining a consistent skincare regimen helps ensure that changes in your schedule don’t translate to changes on your skin.

Travel Essentials for Face and Body has everything you need to maintain your skincare regimen in travel-friendly sizes. This set includes The Lancer Method—Polish, Cleanse, and Nourish—for your face as well as your body. You are able to polish away the dull skin created by drying travel accommodations, remove all traces of dirt and impurities left on your skin throughout your trip, and nourish and revive your skin for a visibly renewed glow. You may feel the strain of travel, but your healthy-looking skin won’t show it.
Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate.
Regardless of how you travel, the stagnant air inside any vehicle is likely to dry out your skin. Air conditioning and sun exposure both cause dehydration, which can translate to dull, dry skin. Plan for extra hydration, inside and out, to compensate. While you are traveling, make sure you drink plenty of water to keep your body hydrated from the inside. Provide luxurious hydration for your skin with Intensive Night Treatment, featuring Marula oil and soybean extract to bolster moisture and reduce flakiness, helping skin remain radiant and looking youthful.
Don’t forget the details. 
Shakespeare said the eyes are the windows to the soul, but when you are travel-weary, your eyes may betray more than you’d like. Long hours on the road and sleeping away from home can mean minimal rest, resulting in puffy eyes and dark circles. Rely on a rich eye treatment cream, like Eye Contour Lifting Cream, to hide your fatigue. Caffeine-based agents help reduce puffiness and minimize the appearance of fine lines on the delicate skin around the eyes. Concentrated plant flavonoids reduce the appearance of dark circles, helping you appear fresh and rested no matter how much sleep you may have missed during your travels.

Treat and protect. 
Once you have prepped your skin with ample hydration, you’ll want to protect it from the elements. Sheer Fluid Sun Shield SPF 30 protects the skin from damaging UV rays while fighting the appearance of photo-aging. This sunscreen not only provides sun protection, but also leaves a smooth, non-greasy finish that provides the ideal base for makeup. Protecting your skin has never looked so good.
If you do spend time in the sun, you may find that your skin in less even and you might even develop areas of overpigmentation. Thankfully, treatment products like Fade Serum Intense improve the texture and tone of your skin. LES-10 Brightening Complex and licorice root extract help reduce the look of dark spots and minimize uneven pigmentation, resulting in skin that appears noticeably healthier and more radiant.
Indulge as you indulge. 
Whether traveling for business or pleasure, make sure your itinerary includes time to take care of your skin. A sheet mask, like the Lift and Plump Sheet Mask, is an ideal way to pamper your face and give yourself some much needed downtime during travel. Simply smooth the sheet mask over your clean, dry skin and relax with a magazine. After 10-15 minutes, remove the sheet mask to reveal skin that looks lifted and rejuvenated.
If you find your body is showing the telltale signs of travel, extend your skincare beyond your face and smooth on Contour Décolleté to plump the delicate skin on your neck and chest. Active ingredients like red seaweed and hyaluronic acid improve the skin’s surface texture and provide the essential hydration lost during travel.
Travel can be hard on you and your skin. Maintaining proper skincare while you travel can make all the difference in the world, so you can explore the world looking your best.

Make your skin glowing and radiant for the season! Apply these 10 easy tips to have flawless skin.

Avoid hot water for showers & baths. Excessive heat dries out skin.
Apply sunscreen more frequently—once in the morning won’t protect you all day.
Eat fresh food – preferably organic.
Avoid eating yeast & sugar. An overflow in your body causes inflammation.
Remove make-up before sweat-inducing exercise.
Get regular facials from a licensed aesthetician.
Wash your pillowcase every week with a fragrance-free, gentle laundry detergent.
Don’t touch your face! And clean anything that does touch your face (like cellphones).
See your dermatologist for an annual head-to-toe skin exam.
Prevent visible signs of aging & maintain youthful skin by investing in high-end skincare.

Do you ever notice how you feel after eating certain foods? Take coffee or sugar, for example—you get a quick energy boost, followed by fatigue. You may also notice that in weeks where your caffeine or sugar intake is especially high, your skin may look less healthy. Caffeine raises cortisol levels and sugar suppresses the immune system, resulting in skin that looks dehydrated and less healthy due to toxins staying in the body.
This is why it’s important to discover foods that provide your body with the fuel it needs to function! It just so happens that many of these foods have additional skin benefits, too, and we’ve found a couple recipes to help incorporate them into your anti-aging lifestyle.
Kale, Apple, Raspberry, and Goji Green Smoothie: Why not start the day the Los Angeles way with a green smoothie? While you can create many different variations of smoothies, this one is a hit due to its many benefits! Kale reduces oxidative stress, while the raspberry and goji berries provide sweetness and antioxidants to neutralize free radicals and stimulate collagen production. If you’re not a raspberry fan, how about subbing blackberries instead? The darker the berry, the higher the content of vitamins C and E.
Recipes That Are Delicious and Amazing for Your Skin – Goodness Green
Roasted Tomato and Red Pepper Soup: Tomatoes have tons of antioxidants and lycopene, which helps to repair skin cells and protect you from UV damage. Add a piece of lean beef on the side, since it’s a good source of protein and iron, and a bit of wild rice or quinoa to the soup since they are high in fiber and can keep blood sugar levels stable. Because tomatoes are acidic, you should eat this soup in moderation, or sub out the tomato for more peppers.
Recipes That Are Delicious and Amazing for Your Skin – Deliciously Ella
Dark Chocolate Avocado Truffles: You can have great looking skin and occasionally eat dessert, too! For when you want to feel indulgent, reach for this delectable truffle. The resveratrol and flavinols in dark chocolate promote circulation and protect against moderate sun damage, while avocados smooth the brown sugar, vanilla extract, and a touch of salt while also acting as a rich source of monounsaturated fatty acids and biotin (a water-soluble B-vitamin) for healthy skin.
Recipes That Are Delicious and Amazing for Your Skin – Apple of my Eye
All of these recipes have the Lancer seal of approval, and certainly sound like the makings for a delicious fall or winter day! Incorporating the anti-aging lifestyle of lean meats, vegetables, and fruits high in antioxidants and nutrients into your Lancer Method skincare routine will have your skin shining in no time.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/machine-based-dermatology-treatments-you-may-know-about-and-love/,"Machine-Based Dermatology Treatments You May Know About and Love
When it comes to machine-based dermatology treatments, the most common machine that comes to mind is one with a laser. Laser removal has become the preferred treatment when it comes to making unwanted tattoos, hair, or veins disappear, and has expanded further into treating (and removing) stretch marks and scars. In fact, you can see how Dr. Lancer used a laser to soften and remove a scar from The Oprah Network’s “Livin’ Lozada” star Evelyn Lozada’s forehead.

Machine-based dermatology has allowed many clients to address longstanding skin concerns without dealing with long recovery times. This is because laser technology—and machine-based dermatology overall—has allowed dermatologists to offer more services while being as minimally invasive as possible.
Because machine-based dermatology allows for such a quick recovery time, clients can schedule their treatments and expect to be out of the office quickly without having to worry about what they look like after treatment. Some procedures, such as those involving a laser, may require multiple visits in order to successfully treat the concern. This is why it is important to receive machine-based dermatology treatments—and any skin treatment, really—with your dermatologist versus going to a medi-spa. Medi-spas are known for their quick turnaround times, whether it’s for Botox or laser hair removal, but one should be cautious of them, especially when it comes to machine-based treatments. Machines have to be set for frequency, energy, fluence, power, penetration, beam configuration, depth of penetration, and diameter of the laser beam, so you need a specialist who knows how to set up the equipment in the right way for your skin. At Lancer Skincare, all of our aestheticians have worked alongside Dr. Lancer, and Dr. Lancer is always in the office, meaning you can trust the hands operating the machine.
Here is an offering of some of the machine-based treatments we offer at Lancer Dermatology, our clinic where we provide expert skincare with a personal touch:
Laser Fractionated Restoration 
If you’re concerned about your skin tone, wrinkles, or spots like age spots, sunspots, pigmentation, and scarring, this is the treatment for you. Laser Fractionated Restoration directs closely spaced, microscopic beams to the trouble spots while preserving healthy skin. This results in minimal discomfort since specific areas of the skin are targeted, and you’ll be out of our office and back to work after a 45-minute session. To achieve optimal results, expect to receive treatment about once a month for four to five months.
PicoWay
When it comes to using state-of-the-art, innovative technology, you can expect Dr. Lancer to be at the forefront of machine-based dermatology. Dr. Lancer was the first dermatologist in the U.S. to offer the Picoway, a dual wavelength laser that quickly transmits the laser to the tissue in order to break up pigments more effectively. This process causes the body’s self-repair mechanisms to be triggered, resulting in skin healing itself back to normal pigmentation.
Ulthera
Do you notice that, generally, you appear tired? This could be because of brow sagging or excess skin around your eyelids. Outside of using the Lancer Method and our Eye Contour Lifting Cream to increase your collagen and elastin production (which keeps skin firm), we recommend treating yourself to some ultherapy via our ulthera machine. You may be familiar with ultrasounds, as they are commonly used during pregnancy or other examinations. Ultherapy utilizes ultrasound energy to lift skin tissue without disrupting the skin’s surface layer.
Machine-Based Dermatology Treatments You May Know About and Love – Eye Contour Lifting Cream
Venus Freeze
One of skin’s natural healing responses is the production of collagen, which allows for skin to look and feel taut. The Venus Freeze stimulates collagen production by using the (MP)2, a machine that combines radio frequency and magnetic pulses to cause a thermal response in skin tissue, which addresses wrinkle reduction, cellulite reduction, and (of course) tightens skin.
Venus Viva
The Venus Viva treatment uses another machine that Dr. Lancer is the first dermatologist to use! The NanoFractional Radio Frequency machine distributes dermal heating in order to achieve immediate, long-term results when it comes to skin tone issues, like pore size and textural irregularities, skin elasticity, and wrinkle reduction.
These are only a few of the many treatments available to Lancer Skincare clients. Find out what else we offer at our Lancer Dermatology clinic by calling our office at 310.278.8444 today!

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/what-is-a-medi-spa-and-is-it-safe/,"What is a Medi-spa and is it Safe?
Medical spas, commonly referred to as medi-spas in the skincare industry, is a medical clinic hybrid that also acts as a day spa. The day-spa aspect allows you to go in for a specific treatment like laser hair removal, microdermabrasion, and Botox, and walk right out the door. In a society that wants immediate results, people are inclined to go for the quick fixes or quick appointments without having to continue maintenance for the rest of their lives.
As tempting as the idea of medi-spas may be, we highly advise you to be cautious of them. Although there may be a medical doctor on staff, you may never see that particular dermatologist or other physician on the premises. In fact, they may not even have much to say about the treatment you chose for yourself! Most likely you will receive treatment from a medical assistant or nurse rather than a board-certified doctor. The benefit of having a board-certified doctor by your side means that you will be able to have a longer, in-depth conversation with your doctor before committing to costly and sometimes risky procedures. And while there have been advances made in technology that allow for minimally-invasive procedures that could be less expensive and require less time for recuperation, the procedures are only as good as the professional performing them. When you have a board-certified doctor by your side, you are receiving advice from someone who has studied and specialized in treating whatever your skincare concerns are, and will be able to consider all available options and risks with you before you commit to anything.
We take pride in our minimally-invasive approach to skincare with our three-step Lancer Method that was developed based on over 30 years of studying how skin naturally heals and regenerates itself. Without even knowing it, you already hold the key to your anti-aging treatment, which is your very own skin. By investing more in your skincare and your dermatologist, you are actually being more cost-effective and can create a skincare regimen that really lasts a lifetime.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/why-is-exfoliating-so-important/,"Why is Exfoliating so Important?
Exfoliating your skin has the immediate result of smoother, glowing skin, and the traditional advice you may have heard regarding exfoliating your skin is to only exfoliate once to twice a week. At Lancer Skincare, we want you to have glowing skin every day, which is why The Lancer Method’s first step is to exfoliate (or Polish) your skin.
Let’s say you want to replace your tile floor. You will notice some set-in stains or discoloration between the tiles due to exposure from shoes or cooking that hasn’t been swept or scrubbed clean. If your epidermis—the outmost layer of your skin—is the floor, then exfoliation is the gentle lifting process that breaks up the old, worn-out tiles.
And just like the tiled floor, your skin has been exposed to sun, air, and the natural process of time, which can end up showing in dark spots or wrinkles.
Now, let me pause to explain what an exfoliant is: an exfoliant is a product designed to remove dead cells from the skin’s surface, and there are many varieties which can be used for different functions: physical (to help speed cell turnover and sweep away debris), chemical (to help lift dark spots, even skin tone and texture, and fade fine lines), and enzyme-based (this helps to dissolve sebum and dead cells). The Method’s Polish is a physical exfoliant, as it uses quartz and sodium bicarbonate crystals to buff away dead skin cells and debris around your pores, reaching deeper than the epidermis to stimulate and accelerate skin cell’s regenerative process, resulting in younger, dewy skin.
When you begin to exfoliate every day, you’ll also notice the added benefits that come with it. Since exfoliating buffs away dirt and debris, your pores will diminish in their size. This will lead to closer shaves and smoother application of makeup while also improving your skin’s texture.
And let’s not forget about the healthy Lancer Glow. You’ll achieve this rosy glow because exfoliating increases circulation and oxygenation, meaning powerful anti-aging action is in effect via the underlying skin cells producing more collagen to plump your skin and, of course, new, younger skin cells. When you exfoliate every day, your skin is being told that the renewal process is necessary, and the combination of new skin cells and collagen results in younger-acting skin while age spots, fine lines, and wrinkles disappear over time.
Exfoliating is a crucial step in your skincare regimen because its controlled inflammation allows your skin to be stimulated by the removal of dead cells and oxygen, so your skin is ready to receive the ultimate benefits of your skincare products! Make sure to look at our Polishes for your face and body, and get ready to exfoliate to a brighter you!

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/8-things-that-can-be-bad-for-your-skin/,"8 Things That Can Be Bad for Your Skin
Skin care is not just about external treatment; rather, your lifestyle affects the way your skin looks just as much as what products you use on it. That’s why we’ve come up with these 8 things that can be bad for your skin. A lot of these can be monitored (e.g. think about moderation), but some of these are everyday activities or lifestyle choices that will make you think twice about your daily routines. Read below to find out what things can be bad for your skin:

Salt: Too much salt may cause inflammation and can aggravate acne.
Sugar: Sugar triggers insulin-production, which makes skin look porous and prone to blemishes. Sugar also breaks down collagen and elastin, which makes skin look firm, so too much sugar may cause wrinkles and dullness overtime.
Caffeine: Caffeine is a dehydrating agent, and causes skin to look oiler, ruddier, and makes pores larger.
Alcohol: Surprisingly, some alcohols are considered a starch (Vodka comes from potatoes, beer is from fermented wheat). Starches have equivalent affects to sugar consumption, since it also triggers insulin-production.
Not Drinking Enough Water: The human body is made up of about 60% water, and varies based on age, weight, health, and gender. Water allows the body’s cells to regenerate, and when you are dehydrated (by the items above or otherwise), your skin ends up looking dull. Make sure for every caffeinated or alcoholic drink to drink a glass of water alongside it so you don’t lose your glowing skin.
Not Enough Sleep: Your body repairs itself at night while you sleep, so going to sleep early will help. Sometimes, people try to lull themselves to sleep with their TV on or looking at their phone until they feel sleepy. This actually has the opposite effects, because the bright screens suppress melatonin, the hormone that makes you sleepy. When your melatonin levels drop, your skin shows it by looking duller and exposing fine lines due to your skin cells being deprived of the time they need to regenerate.
Talking On Your Phone: Throughout the day, your phone is carried and placed on many different surfaces, meaning whatever free radicals in the environment interact with that surface end up on your phone, which ends up on your jawline and cheek, causing breakouts and rashes.
Touching/Picking Your Face: Just like your phone, your hands interact with a lot of surfaces, so you’re transferring that bacteria to your face every time you touch it. Picking at acne with unclean hands can infect the pore, making for an acne scar or potentially more breakouts. Just make sure to wash your hands thoroughly before touching your face, and try to see an expert when it comes to acne to find out what treatments are available for stubborn pimples and/or blackheads.


Like I said, a lot of these things can be resolved via monitoring them: limiting your caffeine intake or TV time before bed can make a huge difference in how your skin looks overtime. I think that once you take these things into precaution, you’ll notice the benefits from the inside out!

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/5-easy-to-implement-tips-from-younger/,"When it comes to staying youthful, there are tons of little tweaks you can make to your lifestyle to keep aging at bay. And, many of them aren’t too arduous. Here are 5 quick and easy tips from Dr. Lancer’s best-selling book Younger that you can implement today:
Move. You don’t have to hit SoulCycle five times a week or train for a marathon. (In fact, working out too intensely can actually speed up aging.) But you do need to make moderate exercise a part of your routine. So take a long walk with a friend, attend a yoga class or go for a bike ride. If you can’t get outdoors, spend 30 minutes doing a workout video or using resistance bands at home.
Pass the salt. Well, what we really mean is pass on the salt. Too much salt causes inflammation in the body and can exacerbate acne. Try seasoning your food with fresh lemon, lime or roasted garlic instead. This week, Dr. Lancer shared a list of the foods he suggests avoiding with StyleBistro. Following these guidelines, by the way, caused him to lose 60 lbs – no joke. Click here for the complete list.
Check your water levels. Staying properly hydrated means more than just downing your eight glasses of H2O each day. If you drink coffee or alcohol, make sure you drink at least one extra glass of water to offset each cocktail or caffeinated beverage. And fill your plate with foods rich in Omega-3s, which help to keep skin supple.
Sleep in. Now you have a valid excuse to hit the snooze button. Your body repairs itself while you sleep, so make sure you’re getting enough and give yourself those extra few minutes of precious shut-eye in the morning whenever you can. If you’re a morning person, move your bedtime up a half hour and catch some extra nighttime zzzzs.
Change up your sleep position. You know when you wake up with creases from your bedding criss-crossing your face? Well, when you sleep in the same position every night, your cheek, jawline, and neck are pushed against the pillow, causing your skin to be folded or creased for several hours. Over the years, those folds become etched into your skin to form sleep lines. So alternate the side you sleep on, or better yet, sleep on your back.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/skin-boosting-winter-detox/,"Juice cleanses seem to have been the ubiquitous health craze of 2013. While days of ingesting nothing but puréed greenery can do remarkable things for your skin and body, the prospect of a cold glass of juice for every meal seems largely unappealing now that most of the country is buried under 6-8 inches of ice.
That being said, it’s the new year and a great time to reset your body with a healthy cleanse.  If cold juice has got you down, we are here with an infinitely more appealing option!
Enter: Goop.  For those of you who don’t know, Goop is Gweneth Paltrow’s lifestyle brand/digital magazine that contains everything from up and coming womenswear brands to healthy eats and cool spots in LA/NY.  Not long ago, Goop put out a “Warming Winter Detox” meal plan that had us (amazingly) super excited to give the cold-weather friendly detox a try.
With a few modifications, we made the three day plan into five full days of meals and snacks.  The pros: we felt AMAZING, the cleanse banished bloat, our skin was dewy and glowing, our hair shiny, and we had tons of energy to boot. Say goodbye to sodium, processed foods, sugar, bread, pasta and animal meat and say hello to a healthy 2014.
Check out the links above for daily meal plans and recipes! Happy Cleansing!

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/lancer-devotee-maggie-q/,"For those of you who are familiar with the beautiful Maggie Q, it should come as no surprise that her #1 skincare secret is the Lancer line.  For those of you who don’t know her striking face, allow us to introduce you.
 
A former model, Maggie Q is now best-known for her role in the CW’s Nikita, where she plays a hard-hitting assassin, and her upcoming part in the film adaptation of Veronica Roth’s best-selling novel, Divergent.  Physical stunts aside, it is impossible not to notice Maggie’s radiant beauty and glowing skin when she’s on screen. A Lancer devotee, here’s what she has to say about her experience with Dr. Lancer and The Method:
“First off, it’s impossible not to love Dr Lancer as a person. He’s a constant and a joy for me. His expertise is a whole other deal. I initially went to Dr Lancer for a skin allergy – nothing to do with beauty. Although it was then that the door to the beauty potential was opened. I trust him because he didn’t get into this [industry] for the reason he is famous today. His beginnings were simple and his intention was motivated by love for what the profession could bring; how it can heal, and change people’s lives for the better. He’s evolved since then, but when I’m treated by him my experience is still the man who is excited about science and discovery. He is extensive in his research and testing before he treats his patients.
And now he has a line of products and method designed to support his work at home.
I’m proud to know him. And grateful he still fits me in. HA! :)”

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/hydration-nutrition-to-beat-the-winter-blues/,"The cold (or chilly if you’re in LA like us) days of winter are always a welcome change from the heat and humidity of summer – but the transition can wreak havoc on your skin. Exposure to the elements combined with the harsh effects of indoor heating and salty holiday food can leave skin irritated, red, flaky, and broken-out.  So what can be done to rescue skin from the winter blues?  Maintaing a healthy moisture balance in the skin and body and keeping cellular turnover at a high rate will help you transition your skin to the winter season.
The first step in winterizing your skincare routine is hydration from the inside out. Start by drinking water and lots of it- at least 10 glasses a day.  If possible, water should be alkaline, as this helps maintain a positive pH level in the body.  The next step is eliminating foods high in sodium, including naturally salty foods, paying special attention to foods that have added salt.  For example, many people assume sushi is a healthy meal option but are unaware of the massive sodium intake that comes with eating dried seaweed and fish.  Other unrecognized sodium culprits include salad dressings, soy-based products, and cheese. Avoiding these foods, and refraining from the use of salt in cooking, will help decrease sodium intake.  Garlic and lemon are two highly flavorful aromatics that can help season food without salt. In addition to avoiding certain foods, it is smart to add foods rich in antioxidants, Omega-3 fatty acids, and Vitamin C which help feed your skin. Supplements can also help with additional vitamin intake.  Chlorophyll supplements can make a huge difference in skin health when taken regularly by increasing oxygenation in the skin and blood.
DO

drink plenty of water (10 glasses a day!)
take vitamin supplements (Vitamin C, Chlorophyll, Vitamin D, Fish Oil)
eat winter greens (kale, swiss chard, spinach)
cook with garlic and lemon to healthily flavor food
read ingredient labels to understand how much sodium you are taking in

DON’T

add extra salt to your food!
replace water with soda or sports beverages
eat processed carbs (white bread, cookies, pastries)

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/younger-approved-recipe/,"Last week, we mentioned a few of Dr. Lancer’s dietary guidelines for younger-looking skin (and weight loss – he lost 60 lbs. on the Younger diet), so this week, we thought we’d share one of our Younger-approved recipes: Grilled Chicken Kale Salad. This salad is a favorite of our staff and is packed with nutrients, protein and healthy fats but free of salt, starches and dairy.  Here’s how to make it:
Ingredients
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing
1 large bunch kale, stems removed, leaves torn (about 10 cups)
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
freshly ground pepper, savory spices (rosemary, oregano)
2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds)
4 cups mixed salad greens
1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
Directions
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Toss the tomatoes with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil on a rimmed baking sheet; spread in a single layer and roast 5 minutes. Toss the kale in a large bowl with the garlic, 1/2 tablespoon olive oil, and pepper to taste. Roast until the kale is crisp, stirring once, 15 to 20 minutes.


Meanwhile, preheat a grill or grill pan to medium and brush with olive oil. Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally to make 4 cutlets. Coat evenly with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil and season with pepper and/or savory spices. Grill the chicken until well marked and cooked through, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.
Toss the kale, the remaining 1/2 tablespoon olive oil, the salad greens, tomatoes, lemon juice, and pepper to taste in a large bowl. Divide the chicken among plates and top with any collected juices. Serve with the kale salad.
Enjoy!

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/the-best-anti-aging-exercises/,"Most of you already know how important it is to work out on a regular basis, but what some, especially our uber-fit clientele in Los Angeles, might be surprised to hear is that there is such a thing as working out too hard. Despite what Hollywood might tell you, you really can be too thin and too fit. Too much strenuous exercise causes inflammation in the body and doesn’t just damage joints – it also damages the skin and breaks down collagen and elastin. What you should aim for while exercising – instead of racing the guy next to you on the treadmill – is to gently increase the blood flow to your organs, stimulate your metabolism and help your body eliminate toxins so you leave the gym look radiant, rather than run-down. Here are 5 forms of moderate exercise that will help you get – and stay – younger.
Elliptical. You don’t have to measure up to the meatheads at your gym. Hop on the elliptical with a magazine (or maybe a book – hint, hint) and spend 30-40 minutes moving at a moderate pace of 3.5 – 5 miles per hour.
Yoga. Tap into your spiritual side at a Hatha yoga class that focuses on deep breathing and stretching. This will do wonders for oxygenating your muscles and detoxing your system.
Pilates. Pilates is a wonderful way to both gently strengthen and stretch the body. Our good friend and Broadway actress-turned-Pilates instructor Debi Monahan created a simple, anti-aging Pilates workout for us that you can do anywhere. It is outlined on pages 205-211 of Younger.
Stroller Pushing. This one’s for all you moms out there. Having little ones makes it tough enough to sneak away to the gym, so do yourself a favor and kill two birds with one…well, stroller. Pushing a stroller a mile and a half in 30 minutes is an ideal moderate work out. Even better: do it while catching up with a friend. You’ll get some added stress relief from spending time with a pal.
Swimming Laps. If you have any sort of injury, swimming is an excellent form of exercise. You’ll get a great cardio workout without all the pressure on your joints. Swimming is also very meditative and great for reducing mental as well as physical tension!
Oh, and one last thing: if you choose to exercise outdoors, don’t forget your sunscreen!

The Best Anti-Aging Exercises was last modified:  March 4th, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer",The Best Anti-Aging Exercises,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/lancer_skincare_antiaging_exercise.jpg

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/carry-on-essentials-for-glowing-skin/,"Traveling typically doesn’t do your skin any favors. Between dehydration, the temptation to eat tons of processed foods (because nothing else is around), and the overall germy-ness of airports and airplanes, keeping your skin in peak condition can be tougher than scoring an upgrade on an overbooked flight. So for all you jet-setters out there, make sure to pack these travel essentials in your carry-on next time you skip town:
1. The Basics Now you never have to leave home without The Method. Smartly packaged in TSA-friendly sizes, our new Travel Set is ideal to have on hand for red eye flights and your final destination. Choose from the regular or deluxe set: both contain Polish, Cleanse, Nourish and Eye Contour Lifting Cream. The deluxe set also includes our Lift Serum Intense and Intensive Night Treatment.
2. Soothing Tea Bags The most important thing you can do for your skin while flying is to drink lots of water. A good rule of thumb is 8 oz. per hour in the air, starting when you are still on the ground. You can also bring herbal tea bags (Dr. Lancer likes chammomile best) and request hot water from the flight attendants. And pass on the coffee and mimosas; caffeine and alcohol speed up dehydration and glycation.
3. A Shea Butter-Based Lip Balm Lips tend to dry up and chap faster in the air. Karite Lips is our favorite antidote for cracked, painful lips. It’s made from all natural ingredients and doesn’t wear off in minutes, like so many lip balms do. And, if your lips are already chapped, this miracle balm will help to heal them.
4. Healthy Snacks Plane food is processed food, which means it’s not good for your skin. So plan ahead and pack a glass tupperware with carrots and sliced cucumbers to help battle hunger and hydrate your skin. Raw (or sprouted), organic almonds make for a good protein boost and are easy to tuck away in your bag.
5. Hand Sanitizer Touching your face with dirty hands can cause breakouts, so keep your hands free of bacteria with a natural hand sanitizer like this amazing smelling lavendar spritz. It’s the perfect size to keep in your purse at all times – whether you’re traveling or not.
6. Hand Cream Hands are feet are some of the first body parts to lose moisture when you board the plane. Keep them supple with a rich hand cream like this travel size one from L’Occitane.
7. An Atomizer Bring an atomizer aboard to help keep skin hydrated while you fly, giving yourself a little spritz whenever your skin feels tight (or every couple of hours). Before you deplane, an atomizer is the perfect tool for freshening up.

Carry-On Essentials for Glowing Skin was last modified:  March 4th, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer",Carry-On Essentials for Glowing Skin,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Lancer-CarryOnEssentials-1.jpg
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Lancer-CarryOnEssentials-1.jpg,,,
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/64/,"No matter how well you care for your skin, there are times it can be hard to maintain a meticulous regimen, especially when you’re away from home. Last week we posted about how traveling can tax skin health: Flying speeds up dehydration and sun exposure, and upon landing, a change in hard or soft water and air humidity can easily irritate skin and cause breakouts and dryness.
But few climates are as brutal as the SoCal desert combined with the party atmosphere of Coachella. For nearly 15 years, Angelenos having been trekking to the desert to spend three days enjoying the music, sun, food and crowds that make up the famous festival. While we’re all for having some good, healthy fun—which Coachella makes easy with vegan and vegetarian food options, juice stands and fresh fruit—there are few things more taxing than three full days of sun exposure, ultra dry and hot temperatures, and the inevitable cocktail or five, we mean, two.
Our marketing coordinator headed to Coachella armed with her Lancer arsenal, but had a hard time maintaining her regimen in the desert. “My skin was super irritated from the heat, dry from the air, and so dirty. As much as I wanted to polish all the grime away, I knew I would be exposed to the same thing the next day, so I held off on polishing, and stuck with tons of Sheer Fluid SPF, Nourish and eye cream to stay as hydrated as possible.”
Even being so proactive, Madeline found that her skin suffered: “I can see the pigmentation on my nose, around my eyes and in the hollows of my cheeks from the sun. Plus some congested pores from all the sweat and dirt. I want my Lancer glow back!”
So what are the doctor’s orders for tackling post-Coachella skin? Check out Madeline’s rehab regimen below:
Diet. Beautiful skin starts from within, so the first step is to boost your daily intake of water and greens. This will make a big, and noticeable, difference. If you’re jonesing for something with more flavor than good old H2O and celery sticks, try Pressed Juicery‘s Greens 3 and coconut water for extra hydration.
Skin Care. It’s important to be diligent about your daily regimen once you’re back from the desert. Since returning from Coachella, Madeline has been following these steps:
In the morning:
1. Wash with Sensitive Cleanse and pat skin dry
2. Retexturizing Treatment Cream
3. Sensitive Nourish
4. Sheer Fluid Sun Shield
5. Eye Contour Lifting Cream
At night:
1. Remove makeup with grape seed oil
2. Steam face for 5 minutes in the shower
3. Polish
4. Sensitive Cleanse
5. Advanced C Radiance
6. Sensitive Nourish
7. Eye Contour Lifting Cream
Next week, we’ll be sharing Madeline’s before and after photos – be sure to check back!

Desert Skin Rehab: Fighting the Effects of Fun and Sun at Coachella was last modified:  March 4th, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer",Desert Skin Rehab: Fighting the Effects of Fun and Sun at Coachella,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/LSC-DesertSkinRehab2.jpg
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/desert-skin-rehab-part-2/,"Last week we gave you the rundown of our marketing coordinator Madeline’s post-Coachella skincare rehab regimen. And now we’ve got the photographic proof of its speedy efficacy. Just one week after returning from the desert, Madeline’s Lancer Glow is back!
Upon returning from Coachella, Madeline’s skin was angry. Overexposure to the sun, heat and dry desert air had caused it to break out, dry out and become unevenly pigmented. To remedy this, Madeline exfoliated with Sensitive Polish for the first four days to jumpstart the cell renewal process. Exfoliation also causes blood circulation to increase, and this helped her blemishes to heal quickly without scarring. Plus, by using Polish in conjunction with a healthy daily dose of Sensitive Nourish, Retexturizing Treatment Cream and Advanced C Radiance and drinking a green juice and extra water each day, Madeline’s skin quickly regained hydration from the deep layers to the epidermis – hence her radiant glow. In the after photos, you can see what is, quite frankly, a miraculous recovery: redness is drastically reduced, pimples are nonexistent, her coloring is even, and her flaky, scaly skin is now smooth and soft to the touch. All just in time to go back for Stagecoach and do it again! (Kidding.)

Desert Skin Rehab: Part 2 was last modified:  March 4th, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer",Desert Skin Rehab: Part 2,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/LSC-DesertSkinRehab21.jpg

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/our-at-home-facial/,"Spring is the perfect time of year to pamper yourself with a luxurious at-home facial. As the weather warms up, you’ll want to exfoliate away dry, flaky winter skin in order to dive into the new season with a fresh-faced glow. Here are a few steps you can take to get your skin hydrated, plumped and glowing for springtime with all-natural ingredients that you probably already have in your pantry.
Fresh Start Step 1: Polish The crucial first step in getting a springtime glow is exfoliation. Start by removing your makeup thoroughly using grapeseed or avocado oil. Then mix one part grapeseed or avocado oil with two parts white table sugar. Smooth the mixture onto your slightly damp face, and using a light touch, make small, upward, circular motions with your middle two fingers. This process removes dry, dead skin cells allowing the active ingredients in your products to better penetrate the skin.
Fresh Start Step 2: Cleanse Wash away any remaining exfoliant with a mild cleanser.
Fresh Start Step 3: Nourish Next, mix a nourishing face mask by combining one part raw honey and one part full fat buttermilk. Smooth the mixture onto your face and leave it on for five minutes. The lactic acid in the buttermilk will break down dead skin cells (which you can then sweep away), and the honey will give your skin an infusion of healthy antioxidants and kill any bacteria left on your face. Your skin will feel supple and nourished and – what’s even better – the effects of environmental stressors will be reversed.
Fresh Start Step 4: Hydrate Now that your skin is plumped with vitamins and hydrated, seal in all the good moisture. Slather on a rich, antioxidant-heavy moisturizer. Gently dab eye cream around the eye area.
Fresh Start Step 5: Protect You can have the best skincare in the world, but it won’t make an ounce of difference if you aren’t protecting your skin from the sun. Cover your face, neck and chest with an SPF of at least 30 prior to going outdoors.

Get A Fresh Start to Spring with Our At-Home Facial was last modified:  March 4th, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer",Get A Fresh Start to Spring with Our At-Home Facial,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/lancer_athomefacial_pink.jpg
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/lancer_athomefacial_pink.jpg,,,
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/quick-skincare-fixes-for-busy-moms/,"We know you moms out there are busy – and that between carpool, your career and attempting to put a homemade meal on the table each night, it can be almost impossible to find time to take care of yourself, much less take a full hour for a facial or a visit to the derm. So, we put together a few quick fixes for common skincare problems so that you can spend more time helping with homework and less time worrying about how you’re going to get a few hours to yourself.
Quick Fix 1: Banish a Blemish with Greek Yogurt. You wake up with a monstrous zit and the last thing you have time for is a trip to the aesthetician to get it extracted or injected. Don’t stress: dab Greek yogurt on your blemish before going to bed. The probiotics in the yogurt will kill any bacteria while lactic acid will break down the bump. It may take a few days to heal, but it will eventually disappear.
Quick Fix 2: Unload Undereye Baggage with Green Tea Bags. If a teething baby or sick little one kept you awake all night, fake a restful look by steeping two green tea bags. Cool them in ice water, then place them over your undereye area for 10 minutes. The caffeine will reduce inflammation and increase blood flow for a fresh, I-got-a-full-8-hours appearance.
Quick Fix 3: Heal a Burn with Honey. The kitchen can be treacherous territory, especially if you’re rushing to put a meal on the table. If you happen to get a minor burn in the process, treat it by slathering on a coating of raw honey. Raw honey has antibacterial properties and will help to hydrate the skin all while making that stinging feeling dissipate.
Quick Fix 4: Keep Oil at Bay with Apple Cider Vinegar. If you run out of your favorite skincare products before having a chance to pick up replacements, tame oily skin by diluting apple cider vinegar with water and using the mixture as an astringent. It’s excellent for balancing the skin’s pH.
From all of us at Lancer Skincare, Happy Mother’s Day!

Quick Skincare Fixes for Busy Moms was last modified:  March 4th, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer",Quick Skincare Fixes for Busy Moms,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/lancer_mothersday.jpg

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/our-guide-to-getting-bikini-ready/,"Memorial Day weekend is almost here, and you know what that means: the unofficial start of summer and the onset of swimsuit season! We put together our ultimate guide to getting bikini ready, so that you can greet the season with a full-body Lancer glow.
If you want to look truly lit from within, you have to start from the inside out. We recommend having a green drink for breakfast each morning to deliver a serious dose of nutrients to your skin. This will help to keep your skin hydrated and healthy while you shed toxins (and possibly pounds). This simple and delicious Lemon-Lime Coconut Refresher is a favorite amongst everyone in our office. To make it, blend the following ingredients together until smooth:
1 whole orange (peeled)
1 whole lime (peeled)
1 whole lemon (peeled)
1 large handful of chopped kale
1 handful of fresh coconut meat
1 scoop of ice
1 cup – 1/2 cup coconut water
All ingredients should be organic when possible, and to further cut down on bloat, stay away from sugar and salt at all times.
Whether you’re already a Lancer Method devotee or are just starting out, be sure to stick to our Polish, Cleanse, Nourish system, which swimwear designer Melissa Odabash swears by.  “I saw results within a week of using the Lancer 3-step Method, which left my skin feeling smoother and rejuvenated – a must-have for a glowing beach-beautiful complexion,” she wrote on her blog. But during swimsuit season, it’s crucial to add a fourth step – full-body exfoliation. You can make an easy at-home scrub by mixing one part grapeseed or avocado oil with two parts white table sugar. This mixture is gentle enough to use everyday and will help to increase circulation, slough off dead skin cells and reduce the appearance of cellulite. In July, we’ll be unveiling the Lancer Body Method for those of you who want a professional grade product for at-home use. (Stay tuned for the launch!)
Of course, sun protection is of the utmost importance during bikini season. Be sure to apply our Sheer Fluid Sun Shield every two hours (or more if you’re swimming or perspiring), wear a sun hat to protect your face and stay in the shade as much as possible.
If you do happen to get singed by the sun, take two 325mg enteric coated aspirin twice daily for two days after your exposure and slather grapeseed oil over the area. Sun exposure can also be helped with the use of our Lift Serum. The plant-based stem cells in the formula help repair damaged skin cells and speed up the healing process. To lock extra moisture into the skin, use a fine mist of purified water between products. This works a little bit like mayo on a sandwich, allowing the products to stick together. And of course, don’t forget to Nourish, Nourish, Nourish!

Our Guide to Getting Bikini Ready was last modified:  March 4th, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer",Our Guide to Getting Bikini Ready,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/LANCERBIKINIREADY.jpg
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/LANCERBIKINIREADY.jpg,,,
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/7-stress-busting-tips/,"Last week, Dr. Lancer revealed to New York Magazine’s The Cut what the fountain of youth is: low stress levels and plenty of sleep (in conjunction with a healthy dose of preventive skincare). Living a stress-free life is easier said than done, of course, but you’ve gotta start somewhere. Here are 7 simple ways to reduce stress starting right now.
Meditate. Study after study has found meditation to have amazing stress-reducing benefits. If you’ve never tried it before, begin by sitting comfortably in a quiet place. Focus on your breath and choose a positive mantra (for example, “I am calm, centered and relaxed” or “I am happy and healthy.”) to repeat. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your mantra. Try doing this for ten minutes each day to center yourself and release built up tension.
Cook a healthy meal. If the mere idea of meditating makes you squirm, there are plenty of other ways to actively meditate. One option: lovingly prepare a healthy meal for yourself (and your family or loved ones). Cooking is very grounding and allows you to tap into your creative side at the same time. Try planning your meal ahead of time so that you don’t feel rushed while preparing it.
Exercise. Tired and stressed after a long day? You don’t have to run a marathon, just do something to get your body moving and energized. Try stretching out on your back or going for a walk in the sun (wearing sunscreen, of course!). It will help your body produce natural endorphins to fight off the stress and you’ll sleep better (the second key to staying youthful). Many more exercise tips and regimens can be found in Dr. Lancer’s book, Younger.
Laugh. It may be a cliché, but that’s because it’s true: laughter really is the best medicine. Seriously, don’t let a day go by without having a good laugh. Laughter releases dopamine, endorphins and growth hormone – and it helps us feel connected to others.
Pamper yourself. Take a few minutes (or more) to do something just for you – whether that’s taking a candlelight bath, giving yourself and at-home facial (recipe here), turning off your phone/computer/TV for half an hour—take some me-time to recharge and don’t feel guilty about it!
Set boundaries. A lot of us get caught in the trap of saying yes to everything – from dinner invitations to replying to work emails at 11 pm to picking up a neighbor’s kid from soccer practice on a crazy-busy day. And the truth is, no one can do it all. Develop the ability to say no when you need to, and watch your stress levels plummet.
Shop! Okay, it may not be scientifically proven, but everyone at our office agrees that a trip to shopping heaven significantly reduces the residual effect of a pressure-cooker day. Bonus Tip: We spent the better part of this week launching Lancer Skincare at Neiman Marcus Beverly Hills and fell in love with Chef Tzu Chiang at Mariposa restaurant. He is serving an olallieberry dish that is packed full of antioxidants and so rare that it’s only produced for one month of the year in California. So, why not kill two birds with one stone? Indulge in some stress-relieving retail therapy and follow it up with a healthy meal at Mariposa.

7 Stress-Busting Tips was last modified:  March 4th, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer",7 Stress-Busting Tips,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/lancer_stressrelief.jpg

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/sun-protection-myth-vs-fact/,"As you all know, sun protection is uber-important in the fight against aging. We get so many questions about various new sun protection tools and technologies that we thought we’d help separate myth from fact by breaking down what works and what doesn’t. Here’s what Dr. Lancer has to say about 5 alternative methods of sun protection:
UV-blocking clothing. Wearing UV-blocking clothing is a great way to protect your skin when you’re in the sun for extended periods of time playing sports, walking, hiking, driving or doing anything active. UV protection is woven into the fabric and provides full spectrum protection without the worry of mis-applying or forgetting to reapply sunscreen. These items are a smart option for kids or people with sensitive skin.
Drinkable sunscreen. It may sound crazy, but there is a product that claims to be drinkable sun protection called Harmonized H20 UV Neutralizer. But whether it actually works is highly questionable. There is no ingredient information provided by the company, making it impossible to accurately judge the efficacy. Additionally, there is no current scientific or medical evidence that would indicate the possibility of an internal sunscreen protecting the skin externally. Experimenting with sun protection is a dangerous gamble and not worth the potential ill-effects. Stick with externally applied sunscreen and you will be safe.
UV monitoring wristbands. UV monitoring wristbands and patches are a great tool to help monitor how much sun you have had, especially on days when it may be hard to tell, like when it’s overcast, or you’ve been in and out of the shade. The patches or wristbands change color in accordance with the amount of UV light they have been exposed to, letting you know when you’ve had a safe amount of sun exposure and when it’s time to get out of the sun completely.
Super high SPF. Understanding the risks and benefits of a sunscreeen with a super high SPF (think 50 and above) means understanding what Sun Protection Factor truly means. Many people today believe Sun Protection Factor translates to the number of minutes you can spend in the sun and remain protected, when in fact it refers to the level of UV light the sunscreen protects your skin against (it has little to do with time and more to do with the strength of the sun). Much of the concern over high-SPF sunscreens comes from the incorrect consumer belief that they can stay in the sun for 100 minutes without reapplication – leading to overexposure, sunburns and skin damage. For example, an SPF of 50 protects skin from 98 percent of UVA and UVB rays, while an SPF of 100 protects skin from 99 percent of rays. Though the number doubles, the amount of protection does not. So while there isn’t anything necessarily wrong with a super high SPF, do be aware of what you are putting on your skin and how well you are being protected.
Astaxanthin. Astaxanthin is a supplement that is said to help protect skin from damaging UV rays in sunlight. The company that produces it claims that it’s an antioxidant more powerful than beta-carotene, lycopene, and alpha-tocopherants, and that the supplement works wonders against free-radicals and helps with cell protection, including the damage that occurs from UV rays. Even though this supplement may help your body protect and repair itself from free radical damage, the effects of astaxanthin are not strong enough to use in lieu of a true sunscreen.
Have you tried any of these alternative sun protection methods? We’d love to hear about your experiences with them!

The Good, The Bad & The Sunburned was last modified:  March 4th, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer","The Good, The Bad & The Sunburned",https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/lancer_sunprotection3.jpg

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/5-minutes-with-celebrity-makeup-artist-cathy-highland/,"One of the most well known makeup artists in Hollywood, Cathy Highland has beautified more A-listers than a nitpicky accountant could keep track of. From Oscar nominees (Glenn Close, Helena Bonham Carter) to supermodels and celebs so beautiful you’d think nothing could be done to make them look any better, Cathy’s been called in to work her makeup magic. She gave us five minutes of her time to talk Hollywood skincare and more:
Lancer Skincare: What difference does good skin care make in your line of work?
Cathy Highland: It makes a huge difference. Good skin you cannot fake. As makeup artists we can paint on the pretty, but you cannot fake [skin] texture or pore size, and with everything being high def now you really don’t want to have to pile on loads of foundation to cover pigmentation either.  [Pigmentation] is another difficult dilemma, especially on male clients going to red carpet events. Most men don’t want to wear a lot of makeup and I agree, less is more especially on men, but if they have heavy pigmentation and it photographs in a really unflattering way…one has no choice but to apply a more full coverage foundation.
LS: Are there certain skin issues that you find common among clients that need covering up?
CH: I would say spots, sun damage and acne scars are the most common.
LS: Do you have a favorite product in the Lancer Skincare range?
CH: That is a hard one! There are so many, but probably the Polish if I had to choose one. Wait…the sunscreen…and the Blemish Control cleanser, moisturizer and eye treatment! I cannot pick one!
LS: What’s your quickest glowing skin tip!
CH: Polish every day like I have been taught through Dr. Lancer’s office – he’s right! Initially, I couldn’t imagine [exfoliating] daily, but the formulation is so unique, in that it is aggressive in removing the dead layers of the skin, making it radiant. My facialist has encouraged me to be really good about target areas [when polishing] – talk about glow to the skin.
On a side note, both of my older sisters experienced bad rosacea when they went through menopause and they both are on a prescription medication to clear it up.  I was suffering from what I thought were breakouts and going through hormone changes, but Dr. Lancer explained that it was rosacea. I had already drastically changed my diet, almost exactly as Dr. Lancer recommends…but when I went to Dr. Lancer about my breakouts, he had me start on his Blemish Control line which was in development at the time. It was miraculous. My skin cleared up and I have never had a problem since. I swear by it! See, I really cannot choose one product! It is from my own personal experience for many years of using the Lancer line, even as he was developing it, that I have no problem suggesting it to my clients. I am not a salesperson; I never try and sell a client on anything, but you don’t have to with Dr. Lancer’s line…results sell.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/dr-lancer-devotee-angela-bassett/,"Academy Award nominee and Golden Globe winner Angela Bassett has been a Hollywood fixture since the mid-80s, but with her radiant glow, she could easily be mistaken on the red carpet for a fresh-faced newcomer. Besides great genes and a healthy lifestyle (she’s a vegetarian and raw food proponent), the mother-of-two’s anti-aging regimen includes Lancer Skincare products.
“I love the Polish,” says Bassett. “A quick way to rid the face of dead skin cells and reveal the fresh complexion beneath! And the cleanser is delightful. You need such a little amount but feel as if you’ve rinsed away everything you don’t need without stripping the moisture. Smells clean and fresh on top of it.”
“Speaking of moisture,” she goes on to say, “the daily one feels like a treat for your pores along with the Vitamin C and the evening anti-aging formula. I like that they do not leave me oily or greasy.”
If you can believe it, Angela is 55. She doesn’t look a day over 30 to us.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/5-minutes-with-celebrity-stylist-cristina-ehrlich/,"One of the most powerful stylists in Hollywood, Cristina Ehrlich dresses established A-listers such as Penelope Cruz and Tina Fey as well as buzzed-about newcomers like Margot Robbie, Allison Brie and Greta Gerwig. Of course, glowing skin is the ultimate red carpet accessory, and Ehrlich is no stranger to the ins and outs of celebrity skincare. She took five minutes out of her stuffed schedule to chat with us:
Lancer Skincare: What difference does good skin care make in your line of work? 
Cristina Ehrlich: It’s absolutely everything. Basically what I do, which is to help women get ready for a red carpet, is learning by example. When my clients come into my office I have to be a representation of what I will help them achieve; clients turn to me for advice across the board. There is a dietary aspect to my work as well – understanding the healthy way of getting red carpet-ready, and how that parlays into their physical shape. Most importantly, it comes down to their skin being the essential accessory. So much of what we’re doing is finding the colors that give them that sought after glow. And while many people believe this may be makeup, it is really a combination of healthy, beautiful skin, a beautiful shape, and the perfect color combinations. You see a client numerous times before an event – how they stand, which way they face the camera, how they feel, how they look, and it all starts with caring for their skin and body.
LS: Are there certain skin issues that you find common among clients that need covering up?
CE: The number one thing I have come to see and understand when seeking beauty is the value, the necessity, and the importance of water – for hydration and for energy. We have been taught to treat the symptoms in our life. Tired? Eat sugar, drink coffee. But you have to understand what gives you real energy, what will keep you glowing, that is water. Traveling, moving from location to location, being in filtered air, you need to stay hydrated to look good. It was not until I incorporated this into my own life that I saw how important it was for my clients to follow the same standard of hydration.
LS: Do you have a favorite product in the Lancer Skincare range?
CE: First of all, the Polish has literally changed the texture of my skin. It’s amazing, and I’m addicted. But my absolute favorite, favorite product has to be the Advanced C Radiance Cream. I put it all over my face, neck, chest – it feels like velvet and preps skin perfectly for moisture and SPF. It’s even better than a date with a hot guy!
LS: What’s your best get-glowing-quick tip?
CE: Time in a steam room is incredibly relaxing and rejuvenating for the mind and body, and of course, exercise. SoulCycle and hot yoga are my go-tos. And after all that – sleep and water.
LS: We’ve heard you had an interesting experience with Dr. Lancer that extended beyond mere skincare.
CE: During a routine follow up appointment, he inquired about my marital status and then proceeded to describe the exact type of man that he thought would best suit me, and was dead on. He’s a dermatologist, but his services extend to the mind and body! It was like having a life coach in the room with me. Dr. Lancer is adamant about the connection between your personal wellbeing and the health of your skin. I have never known another dermatologist to care for their patients the way he does.
LS: Why do you think The Method works so well for you?
CE: In general, I tend to be a highly disciplined and routine-oriented person, and Lancer Skincare is the first dermatological experience I’ve had that mimics the discipline I have in my life. Dr. Lancer and his team put me on a regimen perfectly suited to my life that has completely changed my skin for the better.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/5-minutes-with-celebrity-makeup-artist-kathy-jeung/,"We have some real luminaries pass through the halls of Lancer Dermatology, and when fashion and celebrity makeup artist Kathy Jeung stops by, it always brightens our day. Kathy has worked with Rita Ora, Rashida Jones, Dita Von Teese, Nichole Sherzinger, Padma Lakshmi and Natasha Bedingfield, not to mention just about every fashion mag out there. The result: an endless knowledge of beauty and skincare, what works…and what doesn’t. Here’s what we learned from her in just 5 minutes:
Lancer Skincare: What difference does good skin care make in your line of work?
Kathy Jeung: For me, proper skin preparation with good skincare is the most important step to a getting a great makeup look. Skin is really the canvas onto which makeup is applied, so how makeup lies on the skin, looks on the face, and its staying power is directly related to products used on the skin beforehand.
LS: Are there certain skin issues that you find common among clients that need covering up? 
KJ: Dark circles and puffiness are a common issue. I’ll use Lancer Eye Contour Lifting Cream to reduce swelling and brighten under the eye, allowing me to minimize the amount of cover-up I’ll use to disguise the problem. I really believe that using skincare tailored to skin type or problem is key to help the issue before makeup, rather than using more makeup to cover it up.
Another common problem I encounter year round are dry, dehydrated lips. Same as with skincare, if the lips aren’t prepared for lip products, makeup will work against you and magnify the problem. I like to use a 2-step method of applying a lip ointment followed by a lip balm or salve. If the lips are starting to peel, use a lip scrub and then apply ointment or salve.
LS: Do you have a favorite product in the Lancer Skincare range? 
KJ: I love Lancer Fade Serum Intense Brightening Complex
LS: What’s your ultimate glowing skin tip?
KJ: To refresh makeup and give the skin a healthy glow, moisten a BeautyBlender sponge with mineral or spring water spray and dab all over your face. For even more dewiness, rub a small drop of moisturizer between your palms and lightly press into skin along temples, tops of cheekbones and sides of face
LS: What is the most unexpected piece of advice has Dr. Lancer given you?
KJ: I have to thank Dr. Lancer for a key piece of advice he gave me quite a few years ago: apply skin products in thin layers. That completely changed the efficacy of the products I used and maximized their benefits, as opposed to my thinking that piling on more of something was better!

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/4-ways-to-get-a-better-nights-sleep-naturally/,"Recently, in an interview with The Cut, Dr. Lancer revealed a three-pronged approach to staying youthful: good skincare, low stress levels (which we covered here) and getting the proper amount of quality shut eye. Today, everyone leads such busy lives that sleep often suffers. Tossing and turning and even insomnia have become commonplace. So, if you aren’t feeling as rested as you’d like, here are a few simple steps to get your brain and body cooled off in time for a restful night’s sleep.
Sounder Sleep Tip 1: Fight the urge to fall asleep in the warm glow of your iPad (or TV). Avoid electronic devices at least an hour (or two!) before bed. The blue light of the screens signals brain activity, which can disrupt the natural, circadian rhythm that helps you sleep soundly.
Sounder Sleep Tip 2: Create a bedtime ritual. This can be as simple as taking a warm shower and lighting a candle for yourself or reading a good book and listening to soothing music – whatever you do, try to repeat it each night. Simple, relaxing rituals help the brain transition from wakefulness to sleepiness.
Sounder Sleep Tip 3: Maintain your sleep schedule. Waking and rising at the same time most days (even weekends and holidays!) will help your body maintain a strong circadian rythmn; you will find it easier to fall asleep and rise feeling refreshed instead of groggy and disoriented.
Sounder Sleep Tip 4: Avoid known sleep disruptors. Stay away from alcohol, caffeine and nicotine a few hours before bedtime. All of these substances greatly disrupt the sleep cycle.
Sweet dreams!

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/mens-skincare-101/,"Let’s face it: skincare is just as important for men as it is for women, but most men don’t live by the “ounce of prevention” adage – and probably need a little prodding from the women in their lives to get going on a healthy skincare regimen. Here are three CORE reasons to get the men in your life protecting their largest organ ASAP:
Facial hair can clog pores. Men have fast-growing facial hair with strong hair follicles that can become easily irritated or congested. Daily skincare, especially exfoliation and hydration, is crucial to keep pores clear and skin healthy. With a little commitment, they can say sayonara to painful and unattractive ingrowns.
Thicker skin needs extra TLC. Men have thicker, more durable skin than women, which is a net positive because they are better protected from the elements. But this sturdier skin also makes the absorption of vital nutrients more difficult. Careful but simple skincare (think: the 3-step Method) will help keep skin healthy, hydrated and in great condition as men age.
Many men aren’t programmed to do it themselves. Women have been taught to care for their skin from the time they became teenagers (or before), and are conditioned to apply creams, makeup, masks and oils first thing in the morning. Men, on the other hand, are not used to wearing anything on their skin and often forgo the use of sunscreen leading to sun damage and prematurely aged skin. Daily sunscreen application is absolutely crucial for men (read just how important it is in Dr. Lancer’s newest LA Times feature); we just need to teach men to get started.  Help your guy by finding a formula he likes – our liquid SPF is popular among many of Dr. Lancer’s male patients because of its quick-absorbing formula and non-greasy feel.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/stem-cells-for-healing-sun-damaged-skin/,"We’ve all heard it a million times: Stay out of the sun! Reapply your sunscreen! Shade yourself! But there are still those instances when we find our noses a little pink at the end of a long beach day, or the tops of our shoulders feeling a bit more crisp than when we left the house that morning.
While it’s never advisable to let the sun damage your skin, there are ways of speeding up the healing process when it happens.  One of these methods is to harness the healing power of stem cells, which stimulates epidermal regeneration at the cellular level, in addition to improving cellular barrier function.
Our Lift Serum Intense was created with plant-based stem cells from the Criste Marine plant – a uniquely resilient maritime plant found in coastal regions of France, which is able to survive both the harsh sunlight and drying salt water conditions of its natural habitat.
Applying our Lift Serum to parched, toasty skin signals the body to send healthy, new cells to replace those that were burned or dried out.  It also helps the skin regain its moisture balance and heals free radical damage. For a bad burn, top off the Lift Serum with natural aloe and a rich moisturizer twice a day, and your skin will be back to normal in no time! That said, you don’t have to just take our word for it: Victoria Beckham swears by it too! See what she tweeted about it over 4th of July Weekend here.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/5-minutes-with-mena-suvari/,"Mena Suvari has rarely had a moment out of the spotlight since her breakout role in American Beauty fifteen years ago. And with three new movies and a pilot coming out, she’s spent the better part of the last year on call for the camera. So how does she keep that fresh-faced glow despite logging serious hours in the makeup chair? We chatted with her to find out.
Lancer Skincare: What difference does good skincare make in your line of work?
Mena Suvari: It’s very important to have a good skincare regimen when you’re working in any type of environment that involves wearing full makeup for extended periods of time. As an actress, I can attest to how wonderful it is to know that I can clean my skin properly with Dr. Lancer’s products, refresh and renew my skin with what it was stripped of by wearing makeup all day, and also protect it for the coming day.
LS: Do you have a favorite product in the Lancer Skincare range?
MS: As per usual, it is difficult for me to just pick one product that I like more than others, as in this case it really is true that the products work together, hand-in-hand. But I will say that I really enjoy the Polishes, as I’m the type of person that loves that “squeaky clean” feeling when I wash my face. It’s probably because of living in a city – even being out during the day causes such a build-up!
LS: Quick glowing skin tip!
MS: I found that after using Dr. Lancer’s products, I didn’t need to wear any makeup during the day. Even products providing the lightest coverage, like tinted moisturizers, weren’t needed. Using The Method is powerful enough to really give me that even skin tone I’ve always wanted.
LS: What is the the most unexpected piece of advice Dr. Lancer has given you?
MS: Well, something that I was very impressed with was that Dr. Lancer talks to you about your specific needs based on your ethnicity and where your ancestors come from, which dictates how your skin will react and behave. For me, he explained that I need to wear sunblock all day every day because I am of Estonian descent, which makes my skin very sensitive to light. In fact, my skin could pigment even from the lighting they use on set! That really surprised me and was something I had never thought of!

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/how-to-care-for-elbows-knees-heels/,"You know the feeling – you slick on moisturizer from head to toe, only to catch a glimpse of an elbow, knee, heel or other problem spot that still looks dry, flaky and discolored. The thicker skin on elbows, knees and heels often requires more care than other parts of the body due to the sheer amount of use we put these areas through – and the extra skin they have in order to bend and flex. Here are three ways to combat unsighlty elbows, knees and heels.
Start with Daily Use of The Body Method. Our new Method for Body is an advanced anti-aging solution that adapts Dr. Lancer’s groundbreaking anti-aging method of skincare to the body and works especially well on extra dry areas such as elbows, knees and heels. If you want to whip problem areas into shape, your first line of defense is a daily regimen of this 3-step Method. Using pure quartz crystals, our self-warming Body Polish exfoliates the skin and infuses it with oxygen and nutrients and readys it to receive additional treatments and benefits. Follow Body Polish with Body Cleanse to sweep away dead skin cells post-exfoliation. Body Cleanse helps to open pores and detoxify the skin while also balancing its pH levels. Finish with Body Nourish to lock in moisture and speed up cell turnover so these areas never look flaky and dull again.
Take a Collodial Oatmeal Bath. If the skin in these areas is particularly hard and – worse – itchy, soothe and soften it with a collodial oatmeal bath. Fill the bath with warm (not hot) water, slowly pour collodial oatmeal (which you can buy pre-made) into the stream of water coming from the faucet to disperse it evenly throughout the bath water and soak for 15 minutes. Follow this with the 3-step Body Method for best results.
Try an Exilis Treatment. If your elbows, knees or heels are seriously dry and need more TLC than an at-home regimen offers, try an in-office treatment such as Exilis to help restore the skin back to its original state. A popular treatment in our Beverly Hills office, “the deeply penetrating radio wave pulses of Exilis effectively penetrate deeper folds of skin and flexural areas of the body, greatly improving texture,” says Dr. Lancer. Once you’ve set the course of a healing path, keep it going at home with daily use of Body Polish, Cleanse and Nourish.

How to Care for Elbows, Knees & Heels was last modified:  March 4th, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer","How to Care for Elbows, Knees & Heels",https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/elbowskneesheels.jpg

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/younger-approved-recipe-coconut-oil-coffee/,"We all know that aside from the helpful pep you can get from a cup of coffee, there are a number of serious downsides to regularly consuming caffeine. OD-ing on the energizing stimulant can wreak havoc on your adrenal glands, putting your body in a stressed state that is detrimental to your mental and physical health.
Recently, everyone at Lancer Skincare HQ was turned on to coconut oil coffee – an unexpected twist on your standard cup of joe that tastes amazing, negates some of the less-than-desirable effects of eveyone’s favorite morning beverage, and supplies a healthy source of fat. Similar to the famed Bulletproof Coffee™ made famous by nutrition expert Dave Asprey, this combination of black coffee with a healthy saturated fat slows the absorption of caffeine into the bloodstream, giving you steady, long lasting energy without jitters or a mid-afternoon slump, and keeps you feeling full throughout the morning.  And not only is coconut oil great for the skin, it also makes you feel less bloated.
If you’re going to switch up your coffee routine, here are a few other things to consider to help make coffee a healthy part of your day:

Buy organic coffee beans. Conventional coffee is heavily sprayed with pesticides which can be harmful to health over time.
Limit yourself to one cup a day, and take a day off every few days.
Avoid caffeine after noon so you don’t disrupt your sleep cycle.

Here’s how to make this amazing, creamy coffee:

Brew your normal cup of black coffee (preferably with organic, single-origin, fair-trade beans).
Pour the brewed coffee (1-2 cups) into a blender and add 1 teaspoon of organic, unprocessed coconut oil. (It’s okay if the coconut oil is still solid, it will liquify in the blender.)
Blend for 30 seconds, or until the coffee has turned a light, creamy, hazelnut color.
Enjoy!

The coffee will take on an entirely different color and texture – almost like that of a latte – when you blend it this way.  If you like your coffee sweetened, add a small amount of raw honey or cinnamon. As you get used to the coconut oil, you can add more – up to a tablespoon – but build up to this level slowly. Too much coconut oil can be harsh on the stomach if you’re not used to it.
Let us know what you think of this delicious blend!

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/dr-lancer-devotee-david-gandy-2/,"Vogue named him one of the world’s top ten male models, he’s been the face of Dolce & Gabbana since 2006, designed an underwear line for Marks & Spencer, and can currently be seen playing Jennifer Lopez’s love interest in her new video “First Love”. Seems like David Gandy is as hard-working as he is really, really ridiculously good-looking.
Like most men, David says he likes to keep his skincare regimen minimal. But even a mug that gorgeous can’t rely on the genetic jackpot forever. To keep his skin youthful and in top model shape, David uses our Method Nourish, which he touted to The Telegraph and has also called the “best moisturizer I have ever used”. He is also a devotee of our ultra-hyrdating Intensive Night Treatment. “I…use Dr Lancer products like their Intensive Night Treatment which is very, very good,” he told the popular UK men’s skincare blog The Grooming Guide.
We’d say he’s not just a pretty face, but one very, very smart man.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/retinol-meet-your-match-mimixyl/,"Clinically proven to signal the skin’s own retinoid receptors to create new skin cells, collagen and elastic fibers, retinol has been the gold standard for anti-aging skincare treatments for over 25 years. Few treatments work as quickly and effectively as retinol, however this anti-aging crusader has some big drawbacks (outlined below).
Enter Younger: Pure Youth Serum. Dr. Lancer sought to solve the retinol conundrum by developing a treatment that is as effective as retinol, but did not have its incidence of irritation and other side effects. The result is Younger: Pure Youth Serum, and more specifically, MIMIXYL™, the technology platform developed by Dr. Lancer that powers the product. Retinol has finally met its match.
Here’s a snapshot comparisons of these two powerful anti-aging ingredients:
Retinol:

Helps to create new skin cells, collagen and elastic fibers.
Works quickly and effectively.

However, it is also:

Irritating and drying to skin.
Not recommended to be used while pregnant or breastfeeding.
Can increase oil production for some men.
Very unstable and reacts with light and oxygen.

MIMIXYL™:

Signals the skin to produce new collagen and elastic tissue
Activates the skin’s retinoid receptors, thereby stimulating the production of collagen, elastin, and new skin cells.
Improves skin tone and elasticity
Lessens the number and depth of wrinkles and fine lines
Calms inflammation
Has none of the side effects of retinol

Clinical results show that MIMIXYL™:

Reduces deep wrinkles by 28%
Reduces skin roughness by 35%
Increases skin elasticity by 13%
Increases skin density by 25%

There’s much more we could tell you about this incredible serum, but seeing and feeling it in action on your own skin is the best evidence of all. The proof is in the results – and we know you’ll love them. Order a bottle today.

Retinol, Meet your Match: Pure Youth Serum Featuring MIMIXYL™ Complex was last modified:  March 4th, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer","Retinol, Meet your Match: Pure Youth Serum Featuring MIMIXYL™ Complex",https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lancer-Retinol-Youth-Serum-2.jpg

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/ask-dr-lancer-how-do-i-reverse-decolletage-damage/,"It’s very common for people to be diligent with sunscreen use on their face, while forgetting their chest area, resulting in skin that gives away their true age – or even makes them look older than they are. Here are six steps you can take to fix sagginess, dehydration or pigmentation of the décolleté area:
1. Don’t Neglect Your Décolletage. Sunspots and other forms of pigmentation can cause your décolletage to appear ancient, so start by bringing your facial skincare regimen down to your neck and décolleté. The skin in these areas and will respond to our three-step Polish-Cleanse-Nourish Method and other advanced treatments, such as our Retexturizing Treatment Cream, which features glycolic acid to help speed up cell turnover and reduce pigmentation.
2. Stay Hydrated. Dehydration is one of the main causes of crepey looking skin in the chest area. Nourish the skin you want to improve with hydrating ingredients such as stem cells and Vitamin C. Our Intensive Night Treatment is especially good for repairing damaged skin while you sleep.
3. Sleep on Your Back. Invest in a super soft pillow that forms to your head and learn to sleep on your back. This prevents creases from forming on your chest (and face) while you sleep. Waking up with an occasional crease from sleeping on your stomach or side may not seem like a big deal, but over time, these creases can become permanent fixtures on your skin.
4. Power Exfoliate. If all else fails, an in-office treatment can really turn back the clock and tighten up any sagginess. Start by booking a Power Peel to exfoliate and get blood circulating in the area, which will help to make the skin appear smoother, more evenly toned and instantly brighten it. Follow a Power Peel with a Dermatude session. An innovation in anti-aging treatments, Dermatude is a painlesss procedure that makes microperforations in the skin to allow certain serums (we use a stem cell serum) to be inserted into the deeper layers of the skin encouraging the skin’s natural collagen and elastin production, revitalizing the cells, and providing intense hydration.
5. Practice Safe Skin. Stay out of the sun whenever possible and always be sure to slather your décolleté with a high-grade physical and chemical sunscreen when wearing a skin-baring neckline. Our Sheer Fluid Sun Shield was formulated so that it won’t leave a mark on your clothes, so it’s safe to apply liberally just before slipping into your ensemble.
6. Keep the Faith. I am working on a top secret formula specifically for the neck and décolleté that will be groundbreaking when it is finally released next spring! Sign up for our mailing list to be the first to know about it.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/dr-lancer-devotee-ryan-seacrest/,"They call him the hardest working man in Hollywood, so it only stands to reason that he’d need a skincare regimen that works overtime too. With a packed schedule that spans from early a.m. call times for On Air with Ryan Seacrest to evenings hosting American Idol and production work sandwiched in between, you’d think the toll of his demanding schedule might show up on his face. But Ryan Seacrest doesn’t look a day over 29. (He’s actually 39.) Of course, with so little time to spare, Ryan requires a pared down skincare system, which is why he’s a fan of our simple, at-home, 3-step Method. He has also spilled Dr. L’s skincare secrets on air (listen here). And when he is able to squeeze in a visit to our dermatology offices, he can’t resist a facial with our resident aesthetician Louise Deschamps for the ultimate Lancer glow.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/the-real-scoop-on-frown-line-fixes/,"That moment when you notice a new expression line forming on your face is one of the most frustrating things about getting older. You may still feel (and act!) like an energetic 20 year-old, but your face is letting you down, giving away your actual age with every passing hour. What’s more, there are so many products and treatments out there that promise a quick fix, it’s hard to sort the wheat from the chaff. So we took the guesswork out of frown line fixes. Here’s the real scoop on what works, what doesn’t, and what you don’t want to overdo.
1. Patches such as Frownies or Furless. Although these ‘miracle patches’ may be tempting, there is absolutely no evidence they make a difference over time. You are much better off investing in high quality pillowcases and learning to sleep on your back to keep your face from getting creased at night. (Over time, those creases can become frown lines.)
2. Botox and Dysport. A popular option for freezing up the facial muscles to stop the formation of expression lines, neurotoxins are highly effective for preventing deep lines and wrinkles, but need to be administered every few months to keep results looking fresh. There is also a risk of “loss of expression” if the doctor administering the injectable is too heavy handed. If you decide to explore neurotoxins further, make sure you trust your doctor and take a light approach.
3. Juvederm and Restylane. Another popular option for deep expression lines, fillers do just what the name implies – fill in deep lines, wrinkles and facial folds. Fillers like Juvaderm are great for deep lines that are already prevalent, but won’t prevent further development of wrinkles. Again, these should be administered by a light-handed professional.
4. Dermatude. One of the newest and most innovative machines in our office, Dermatude is quickly becoming a favorite option for patients looking to reverse expression lines without the follow up appointments or risk of expression loss. The machine pairs micro rolling with radio frequency, triggering the body’s own healing action in the deep layers of the skin, boosting collagen and elastin production and nearly erasing expression lines. This treatment is especially popular with men.
5. Youth Serum. The newest addition to the Lancer Skincare collection, our Younger: Pure Youth Serum is an amazing blend of vitamin A esters and biomimetic retinol compounds that actually speed up the skin’s cellular cycle without the irritation that accompanies the use of traditional retinol. Youth Serum is a smart addition to your regimen if you’re looking to prevent expression lines or correct existing ones.
6. Facial Massage. Facial massage has long been the secret weapon for makeup artists and facialists, giving their clients an immediately lifted and beautifully contoured face.  The gentle stroking can relax facial muscles and connective tissue, thereby softening expression lines, in addition to aiding lymphatic drainage which depuffs the skin.  We love to use our Microcurrent Power Boost as a massage tool, which not only softens expression lines and lifts the skin, but also neutralizes free radicals.

“I swear by Dr. Lancer products. He’s a dermatologist that I met in Los Angeles. I started going to him for oxygen facials, and I haven’t looked back. I don’t really use products other than his. I keep it quite simple with a really good polish, then an exfoliating cleanse, then I use a nourish cream, which is a really beautiful moisturizer. I just do that twice a day, and I think it’s very important to drink lots of water and get as much sleep as you can.”
When asked if she shares her beauty products with husband David Beckham, she added, “You know, he uses all my Lancer products. So we share all of our beauty products.” It seems that the family that cares for their skin together, stays together. Take a look at Victoria’s longtime love for Lancer Skincare below.

Turn Back Time with Pure Youth Serum was last modified:  March 4th, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer",Turn Back Time with Pure Youth Serum,
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/5-pilates-moves-to-help-you-get-younger/,"Pilates is not only a great way to tone the body, but also helps to reduce stress, combat fatigue and improve mental focus and circulation. Doing just a few Pilates mat exercises a day will rejuvenate you both physically and mentally – helping you to look and feel younger. These 5 Pilates moves from leading Pilates trainer Debi Monahan can be done anywhere – at home, at the office, even while you travel.

1. The Roll-Up
Stregthen your spine and abs with this posture-improving move. Start by lying on your back and extend your body into a full stretch with your arms extended over your head and your legs straight and squeezed together. Inhale, drawing in your abs, and lift your arms toward the ceiling. Continue the movement forward, and as your arms pass over your chest, begin to roll up vertebra by vertabra, using your core muscles. Try to lift up our of your hips and over your thights as you pass through a sitting position. Exhale as you stretch forward, keeping your navel pulled back toward your spine and your fingers reaching toward your toes. Then reverse out of the posture by inhaling and rolling back down as slowly as you came up, keeping your abs engaged and your tailbone curled under.  Repeat 3 to 5 times.

2. The Hundred
This ab and breathing exercise helps to increase circulation and warm up the body. Start by lying on your back with your knees and hips bent at a 90-degree angle and your arms resting on the mat beside you. Exhale, draw in your abs, and lift your upper spine slightly off the mat while reaching your arms forward. Straighten and extend your legs to a 45 to 60-degree angle. Begin pumping your arms straight down and then up on each count for a total of 5 counts, inhaling for the duration of 5 and exhaling for 5, reaching forward as you breathe. Maintain this position, pumping your arms and breathing for 100 counts (or as long as good form can be maintained).

3. Single Leg Stretch
Lie on your back with your head and shoulders off the mat, chin toward your chest with your inside hand on your knee and your outside hand on your ankle, elbows extended. The straight leg should be extended in front of you at a height that allows your back to remain flat on the mat. Inhale as you being to bend your straight leg and straighten your bent leg. Exhale as you complete the switch. Your hands switch to the opposite knee and ankle. Maintain core stability while executing, with your abs drawn in and your spine pressed into the mat. Repeat the sequence 5 times on each leg for a total of 10 times.

4. Criss Cross
This sit-up exercise will work your obliques, waistline and core. Start by lying on your back with your head and shoulders lifted off the mat, knees bent into your chest and hands behind your head, elbows wide. Exhale. Straighten one leg while simultaneously rotating your upper body toward the opposite bent knee. Inhale as you being to switch legs while your upper torso rotates back to center. While switching legs, rotate your trunk toward the opposite side and exhale as you fully straighten one leg and bend the other. Complete 5 to 10 sets.

5. Leg Pull
Start this ab, arm, legs and buttocks-strenghtening exercise in a push-up position. Squeeze your buttocks and concentrate on using your abs to stabilize your lower body. (Your body should be in one straight line from the top of the head to your heels.) Inhaling, raise one leg toward the ceiling, squeezing the buttocks. Do not lift your hip when lifting your leg. Exhaling, lower your leg back to the mat. Inhaling, raise the opposite leg. Exhaling, lower that leg back down, always keeping your abs engaged and pelvis lifted to prevent your lower back from arching.

Excercise Your Way to Glowing Skin was last modified:  March 4th, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer",Excercise Your Way to Glowing Skin,
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/the-grammys-bare-faced-beauties/,"Sam Smith may have swept the Grammy Awards last night, but barely-there makeup and glowing skin swept the red carpet. Beyonce, Chrissy Teigen, Ciara, Rihanna, Gwen Stefani and Charlie XCX all rocked natural looks featuring nude lips, subtly rosy cheeks and simple eye makeup framed by bold brows.
The key to making this look work is, of course, flawless skin. In a recent article in the Wall Street Journal, beauty insiders discussed this movement toward the I-woke-up-like-this look. “A lot of women now are taking care of their skin so they don’t have to rely on makeup,” Daniel Martin, a celebrity makeup artist for Dior, told the Wall Street Journal. “For them, it’s a reallocation of time and money. They are spending more on an evening skin-care regimen and facials, and less on a morning makeup routine.
Emily Weiss, of the popular beauty blog Into the Gloss, agrees: “Having great skin allows you to ‘just wake up like this’. The better your skin, the less makeup you have to wear.”
So where do you begin to get red carpet-worthy glowing skin? Start from the inside out with a regimen of morning green juices and diet of lean protein and veggies (skip the carbs, sugar and salt). Add in light, daily exercise to get your blood circulating. Combine with daily use of The Method plus nightly use of our Lift Serum Intense and Intensive Night Treatment to amp up moisture for a fresh, dewy look.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/how-stars-prep-for-the-oscars/,"You already know many of the ways stars prep for awards season – with the Venus Legacy, stem cell facials, cleanses and months-long exercise regimes – but for the biggest red carpet of the year, it’s time to pull out the (really) big guns. Here are three cutting-edge treatments, two of which are exclusive to Lancer Dermatology, that harness the skin’s ability to self-repair. Nothing looks better on the red carpet than a natural glow, which is why we love these three non-invasive, filler-free treatments that will make anyone ready for the glow of the spotlight – whether it’s the Oscars or a real-life red carpet.
PicoWay

PicoWay is an innovative dual wavelength laser that fires one thousand times faster than the fastest laser currently available to the medical community. The ultra-fast picosecond bursts of energy transmitted to the tissue enable the laser to break up pigment more effectively and trigger the body’s own self-repair mechanisms. Dr. Lancer is the first dermatologist in the United States to have this laser in practice. His decision to use this technology is bolstered by the fact that the laser’s ability to trigger self-healing in the skin aligns perfectly with his anti-aging philosophy of stimulating healing self-repair.
Venus Viva

Venus Viva is a NanoFractional Radio Frequency machine that is designed to reduce pore size, correct textural irregularities, soften and diminish wrinkles, and tighten skin laxity, all with minimal downtime and discomfort. The machine uses consistent selectional dermal heating to achieve optimal, immediate and long term results. Dr. Lancer is the first dermatologist in the US to have this machine in his practice.
The Vampire Facial 

Technically known as PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) Microneedling, the “Vampire Facial” involves taking a patient’s blood, putting it in a centrifuge so that the plasma separates from the red blood cells, and then using a microneedling pen to aerate the skin, while applying the plasma topically. The needling stimulates the fibroblasts in the skin to speed up production of collagen, elastin and growth factor, giving skin an amazing glow. This treatment also corrects fine lines, pigmentation, and topical scars. It is ideal to have in adjunct to regular use of The Method because it employs the same science, the skin’s ability to self-repair.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/,,WORLD OF LANCER BLOG,
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/a-guide-to-skincare-devices/,"At-home skincare devices are often billed as cheaper alternatives to professional treatments at a dermatologist, medical spa, or aesthetician’s office. While these skincare tools are often less expensive than in-office treatments, they do still often represent a significant financial investment. If you use them every day, then the tool will quickly pay for itself — but all too many people leave their at-home skincare devices to collect dust in a drawer after trying them a couple of times. So how can you tell if an at-home skincare device is worth the cost for you, and how do you choose which one is right for your skincare concerns?
Should You Get an At-Home Skincare Device?
First of all, we recommend getting into a regular skincare routine to start. It’s much easier to incorporate a skincare device if you already have a set routine in the morning and at night, instead of trying to begin everything from scratch. If you’re not sure where to start, a curated skincare set like the ones offered by Lancer Skincare will give you all the basic products that you need to start building a skincare routine.
At-home skincare devices are less powerful than in-office treatments, so you also need to be committed to using them consistently (in some cases daily) to see results and get your money’s worth. If you’re not willing to use the device at least somewhat regularly, then it might not be worth the investment for you personally.
We also recommend carefully considering what skincare concerns you want to address, as well as what skin type you have overall. Not all skincare devices address all skincare concerns equally well. Even if a particular skincare device is getting a lot of hype right now, it may not be the best tool for your skincare concerns. For example, facial cleansing brushes are great for deep cleaning the skin and getting a light exfoliation, but they’re not that effective for treating lines and wrinkles or acne breakouts. If those are your concerns, you’d be better off with an LED light wand or a microcurrent device.
If you’re not sure what kind of at-home skincare device would work best for you, your aesthetician or dermatologist will probably have some recommendations for you if you ask. Even if you’re getting regular office treatments done, your aesthetician or dermatologist may even recommend an at-home device to extend your results and maintain your skin in between appointments. In the next section, we will explore all the main categories of skincare devices to help you decide which ones might work for your skin.

At-Home Skincare Devices to Choose From

Gua Sha Stones and Jade Rollers
Gua sha stones and jade rollers are some of the most affordable at-home skincare devices, making them a popular entry point. Gua sha stones are flat on both sides with rounded edges that are perfectly contoured for different parts of the face. Jade rollers have a spinning barrel attachment that is connected to a handle. 
As the name suggests, both of these devices are typically made from semi-precious stones such as jade. However, you can find them made out of other stones as well as different materials, such as stainless steel and wood. Gua sha stones and jade rollers promote the circulation of blood and length and also encourage the absorption of your skincare products. They can be used with almost any skincare routine and if you’re asking yourself, what skin type do I have? These products are safe for any skin type, making them a versatile and popular skincare tool.
Ice Rollers and Globes
Ice rollers and globes are designed to be placed in either the refrigerator or freezer to cool them down. Once they are ready, you can apply them to your face or body to reduce swelling and puffiness. Ice rollers are made with a stainless steel barrel on the end that quickly cools down, while ice globes are typically filled with a gel substance that freezes when placed in the freezer. 
Many people like to use these alongside other eye care products first thing in the morning to target puffy eyes and any swelling that may have occurred while they were sleeping. They are also very refreshing to use during hot weather and can help you feel alert more quickly first thing in the morning. These products are also very affordable and can be used by almost any skin type.
Facial Cleansing Brushes
Facial cleansing brushes are designed to deliver a deeper cleanse than just your hands are capable of. They also provide an exfoliating effect, helping to remove dead skin cells and reveal an even complexion. 
There are two main types of facial cleansing brushes: ones with silicone bristles built-in, and then others with a bristle head that needs to be removed and replaced at regular intervals. The facial cleansing brushes with the silicone tips are typically more gentle on the skin, and also more sanitary and easier to clean — plus, you don’t have the expense of having to buy new brush heads all the time. Many oily skin types find that they especially benefit from the extra exfoliating effect of facial cleansing brushes, but they may be too stripping for dry skin.

LED Masks and Wands
LED light at-home devices can have many different benefits for the skin, depending on the color of the light. Red light therapy reduces inflammation and promotes the creation of collagen, which helps to prevent or diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Meanwhile, blue light helps to kill the kind of bacteria that cause acne. Some LED devices have only red or blue light, while others combine both of them for a well-rounded skin care treatment. 
These devices also come in many different sizes, shapes, and price points. LED wands are available in many different sizes, from pinpointed spot treatments to larger wands that cover a bigger area of your face. You can also get LED masks that cover the entirety of your face at once, which reduces the treatment time but costs a lot more and is less portable than a wand. While you can get LED treatments at a dermatologist or aesthetician, many people find it very beneficial to be able to use LED light therapy at home daily.
Dermaplaning Tools
Dermaplaning tools are designed to remove peach fuzz and the upper layer of dead skin cells from your face. They look similar to eyebrow razors, but the blades are typically designed a little bit differently for more effective exfoliation. You can get disposable dermaplaning tools or ones that come with interchangeable blades. Most dermaplaning tools are completely manual, but you can find some battery-powered ones that work similarly to electric razors, which are more expensive than the other types. 
People with sensitive skin or acne-prone skin should be very careful with dermaplaning at home because it can irritate if not done correctly. If you want the benefits of dermaplaning, but aren’t confident about doing it yourself, you can book a dermaplaning appointment at a dermatologist or aesthetician’s office, and a professional will do it for you.
Facial Steamer
You can DIY a facial steamer at home with a kettle of hot water, a bowl, and a towel. However, this experience isn’t super luxurious, and many people appreciate the convenience of a facial steamer at home, which replicates the feeling of a spa. Facial steamers are electronic devices that heat the water and turn it into steam at the perfect temperature for a facial. The devices feature ergonomic funnels perfectly shaped to direct the steam at your face. Many people with dry skin enjoy using a facial steamer at home because it helps to put moisture back into their skin, and also opens up their pores to increase product absorption.

Microdermabrasion Tools
Microdermabrasion tools use the rotating attachment to remove the top layer of skin, revealing a newly smooth and glowing complexion. These electronic devices come with different attachments that can be used to achieve different levels of exfoliation. 
For instance, our Pro Polish Microdermabrasion device comes with two diamond tips, a smaller tip for the face and a larger tip for the body. It also comes with disposable filters to trap dead skin and keep the device working and in optimal condition. The three suction settings allow you to customize exfoliation so that many different skin types and skin tones can use it. This award-winning skincare device comes in four different colors so you can choose your favorite!
Microcurrent Devices
Microcurrent devices pass a small electric current through your face to stimulate the muscles and skin. This stimulates the production of collagen and elastin, making it a great choice for anti-aging skin devices. It also helps to lift and tone the facial muscles, resulting in a younger-looking and brighter complexion. These are among the more expensive at-home skincare devices that you can buy, but many people swear by them. For best results, you need to commit to using it daily if possible. You can also get microcurrent treatments done in the office if you want to try it out first before buying an expensive at-home device.
Pore Extractors
Pore extractors help to remove gunk out of your pores, which is why many people with acne and blackheads tend to use them. The simplest and most affordable pore extractors feature a small loop or a point on the end of a handle that you can use to push around a blemish to extract the pus and dirt inside it. More expensive pore extractors are battery-powered and use either vibration or vacuum-like sucking to remove gunk from your pores. It can be very easy to overdo it with these pore extractors at home, so we recommend talking to your dermatologist before buying an at-home device. You can also get a pore extraction done professionally if you want good results without having to teach yourself how to do it correctly.

At-Home Microneedling
Almost all skincare devices can be used safely at home as long as you’re careful, but DIY microneedling devices harbor many potential dangers. Professional microneedling treatments done by an aesthetician or dermatologist use tiny needles to create micro-tears in the skin, which help to improve both appearance and texture. 
Professional microneedling treatments are very versatile and may be recommended for many different skincare issues, including wrinkles, scarring, stretch marks, enlarged pores, acne, hyperpigmentation, and more. However, at-home microneedling devices make it very easy to penetrate the skin too deeply or to create “micro” tears that are actually more like macro tears. 
It’s also very hard to keep at-home devices completely sterilized, which can cause infection and other complications. If you want the benefits of microneedling, we recommend finding a local aesthetician or dermatologist like Dr. Harold Lancer‘s office, so you can get the procedure done safely by an expert.
We hope this guide helped you feel more confident about choosing an at-home skincare device you will use and that will be effective for your skincare concerns. If you want to try out microdermabrasion, then grab our Pro Polish Microdermabrasion device.

A Guide to Skincare Devices was last modified:  February 28th, 2024 by [email protected]",A Guide to Skincare Devices,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/gua-sha-stones-and-jade-rollers.jpg

Understanding your skin type is key to putting together the best skincare routine for your unique needs. But figuring out your skin type can be tricky, especially if you don’t know what all the skin types are or if you’ve never done a test to figure out your skin type. Here’s everything you need to know to determine what type of skin you have:
What Type of Skin Do I Have?
That being said, most people align most closely with one skin type. Your skin type is important because it determines what products will be most beneficial for your complexion. Slathering dry skin products on oily skin will lead to clogged pores and breakouts, while using oily skin products on dry skin will dehydrate your face even further. The American Academy of Dermatologists (AAD) recognizes five different skin types. They are:

Dry: You skin tends to feel tight and maybe itchy, especially after showering or swimming. It often looks dull or rough and may flake, peel or crack. If that sounds like you, shop Lancer skincare for dry skin.
Oily: Your skin tends to feel greasy and look shiny, especially later on in the day and/or on the forehead and nose. You have large pores that become blocked frequently and probably struggle with blackheads and whiteheads as a result. If that sounds like you, shop Lancer skincare for oily skin.
Combination: Parts of your face are oily, while other parts are normal or dry. Typically the T-zone (nose and forehead) will be oily, while the cheeks and chin will be dry. If that sounds like you, shop Lancer skincare for combination skin.
Sensitive: Your skin is very reactive, becoming red and itchy easily. It may burn or sting when you apply products and may even result in hives, bumps, peeling and other reactions. You might be diagnosed with a particular skin condition such as acne or rosacea, or your reactivity might be more general. If that sounds like you, shop Lancer skincare for sensitive skin.
Normal: None of the other skin types fit you. Your skin is neither dry nor oily, and it’s not especially sensitive either. Your pores are small, you have even skin tone, and you don’t struggle with acne, rosacea or other skin conditions. 

Most people fall into one skin type or another, but some people straddle the line between two of them. For instance, it’s possible to have skin that is both sensitive and dry, or maybe your complexion is combination but tends to lean oily. It’s also normal for most people to get more dry in the cold winter months and more oily in the warm summer months and to switch up their skincare routine accordingly.

How to Determine Your Skin Type
Fortunately, there is a simple test that you can do at home to determine your skin type. Remove any cosmetics products that you might be wearing, and then wash your face with a gentle cleanser. The cleanser should not be stripping, but it also shouldn’t leave any residue behind on your skin.
Pat your skin dry with a clean towel and observe it in the mirror. In some cases, you will be able to feel your skin type right away, especially if you have dry skin. However, you might not be able to figure it out immediately either, which is totally fine. Check your skin at 30-minute intervals to see what changes you are noticing. If you have normal skin, your skin will probably look about the same. If you have oily or combination skin, you will notice your face getting shiny over time, especially in your T-zone. If you have dry skin, it will become tighter and itchier the longer you go without moisturizer.

Depending on the facial cleanser that you used, you might notice your face burning, itching, stinging or flushing red right away. However, if you used a very gentle cleanser, then your skin might not react to it. Think back to using skincare products in the past: Have you often struggled with reactivity, especially with many different products? If so, there’s a good chance that you have sensitive skin. Sensitive skin can also combine with other skin types, so even if you already know that your skin is sensitive, it’s still worth doing the test so that you know what you are working with.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/new-year-new-you-tips-for-building-the-best-skincare-routine/,"The beginning of the new year is the perfect time to reset your skincare routine or build one from scratch. If you’re not sure how to get started, we’ve compiled the ultimate list of 22 tips to help you build the best skincare routine.
Get to know your skin type.
Before you do anything else, you need to understand your skin type. If you don’t know this already, try this simple test: Wash your face with a gentle cleanser, pat it dry, and leave it for 30 minutes (don’t apply any products). After the half hour is up, examine your skin. If it feels flaky or tight, you have dry skin. If it feels greasy and shiny, you have oily skin. If you have red or irritated patches, you have sensitive skin. If you have none of the above, you have normal skin. And if some patches fit one description, but other parts match another, then you have combo skin. Once you know your skin type, you can choose products that match it accordingly.
Set your skincare goals.
Besides your skin type, you also need to understand your skincare goals. You might want to get your acne understand control, treat hyperpigmentation, get started with anti-aging skincare, or any other number of goals. We recommend focusing on one skincare goal at a time to prevent overloading your routine. For instance, you can worry about acne scarring once you reduce your active breakouts.

Follow a 3-step foundation.
At Lancer Skincare, we’re huge fans of the 3-step skincare method: polish, cleanse, and nourish. These three steps form the basis of The Lancer Method and are a great starting point for the best skincare routine. Once you master these three steps and get in the habit of using the products regularly, you can look into adding more steps to your routine if you want to.
Remove your makeup first.
If you wear makeup, we recommend removing it before you use your cleanser. That’s because facial cleansers aren’t really designed to break up heavy layers of cosmetics and will leave product behind on your face. There are many different makeup removers to choose from, including makeup wipes, micellar water, cleansing oils, and cleansing balms. Typically, the more makeup and sunscreen that you wear, the more powerful a makeup remover that you will need.
Choose the right cleanser.
Cleansing can be the most stripping part of your routine, which is why it’s essential to choose the right cleanser. Oily skin types benefit from foaming or gel cleansers that help to remove excess oil, while dry skin types usually prefer milk or cream cleansers that nourish this skin. Normal and combination skin types can use either, depending on the season and climate. Sensitive skin types should seek out gentle, hydrating cleansers. 
Exfoliate the right amount.
Depending on how much your skin can tolerate it and how strong your exfoliating product is, exfoliating daily with the right polish can be great for your skin. 
Don’t skip moisturizer.
Moisturizers are a must because they seal in water and oil and help to prevent moisture loss. Dry skin types usually prefer to use heavier cream moisturizers, while oily skin types prefer a lightweight gel moisturizer that soaks in quickly. Normal and combination skin types often enjoy using a midweight lotion that moisturizes the dry areas without smothering their more oily patches. Applying moisturizer should be the final step in each skincare routine to seal in the other products.

Wear sunscreen every morning.
We know that we just said moisturizer should be the last step, but in the morning you should follow up your moisturizer with another product: sunscreen. Wearing sunscreen every day is one of the best things that you can do to prevent signs of aging and keep your skin looking healthy and young. Some sunscreens are even thick enough to act as moisturizers on their own, allowing you to combine those two steps into one and simplify your skincare routine.
Add in treatment serums.
If you’re looking to get results from your best skincare routine, then you need some serums packed full of active ingredients like vitamin C and retinol. These powerful ingredients offer lots of benefits to the skin and can make a big difference when used consistently. To avoid overpowering your skin, we recommend using one treatment serum per routine and occasionally giving your skin rest days to recover.
Try an eye cream if you’d like.
Eye creams aren’t strictly necessary (or you can just use a regular moisturizer around your eye area) but they can be a fun addition to your routine. If you want to use actives such as vitamin C and retinol around your eyes, then we recommend choosing eye creams specifically formulated for the delicate skin around that area. Products that you use on the rest of your face may be too powerful and irritate your eyes.

Use spot treatments when necessary.
If you have acne blemishes, using a clarifying spot treatment can dry them out and help clear your face faster. For best results, we recommend applying these treatments only to the blemish itself. Spot treatments tend to be very strong and can cause dryness or irritation when applied to unblemished skin, so it’s best to use them sparingly.
Experiment with a face oil.
People with very dry skin sometimes benefit from using a face oil, which creates an occlusive layer on top of the skin to stop moisture loss. You can either apply a few drops of the oil on top of the moisturizer, or mix it directly into the moisturizer and then apply it to your face. We recommend that oily skin types stay away from these products, however, as adding extra oil can clog pores and lead to breakouts.
Have fun with face masks.
Face masks are another completely optional step, but they can be really fun to add to your routine. Face masks can offer many different benefits, from hydrating to exfoliating to brightening to soothing, depending on the ingredients. They also come in different formats, such as a wash-off mask and a sheet mask, so you can choose the one that works best for you. We suggest applying a face mask to a clean, dry face after cleansing but before the rest of your routine.

Don’t skip your neck and chest.
The skin on your neck and chest is very delicate, and you should absolutely be treating it with your skincare products! You do need to be careful with products that are potentially drying, like retinols and exfoliators, since you have fewer oil glands on your neck and chest than on your face. But you definitely can and should be applying gentle, effective skincare products on these areas, as well as sunscreen whenever your skin is exposed in the daytime.
Apply products in the right order.
Let’s say that you decide to go all-in and use all the products we’ve described here. In what order should you apply them? First, start with a makeup remover followed by a facial cleanser, then a face mask if you want to do one. Next, apply your serum, and top it off with a moisturizer and then either a sunscreen in the daytime (not optional) or a facial oil at night (optional). If you get stuck, just remember that leave-on treatments should be applied from thinnest to thickest and you’ll be golden.
Look for multipurpose products.
Overwhelmed by the idea of using this many products? There’s nothing wrong with a simple skincare routine. To cut back on the number of products that you are using, look for multipurpose products that offer multiple benefits and active ingredients in one. This will make your skincare routine more efficient and help stop your skin from being overwhelmed with too many products.
Introduce one new product at a time.
Whenever you get a new skincare set, it’s tempting to start using all the new products at once. However, we highly recommend introducing only one product at a time and giving your skin at least a week to adjust. This will make it easier to identify the cause if a new product triggers an allergic reaction. You may want to keep a log of how your skin reacts to each new product so you can track your progress over time and identify if you have any sensitivities to common ingredients.
Change your routine with the seasons.
The weather and climate have a big effect on your skin, which means that you will almost certainly need to change up your best skincare routine along with the seasons. That lightweight gel moisturizer that is perfect for summer may leave your skin parched and dry come wintertime, so don’t be afraid to pay attention to how your skin feels and switch things up as the year goes on.
Be patient with results.
Topical treatments take time to work, especially if you are using over-the-counter products with lower ingredient concentrations (as opposed to stronger prescription strength topical treatments). If you want faster results, you may need to visit a dermatologist or aesthetician office for professional strength treatments.

Prioritize consistency.
The best skincare routine is the one that you can stick with every day, or nearly every day. If you find yourself skipping days or weeks because you have too many products, pare things down to the 3-step method we talked about above, plus a sunscreen in the morning. Using a few skincare products consistently is much more effective than using many different skincare sporadically or not at all.
Practice other healthy skin habits.
Healthy skin doesn’t start and stop with your best skincare routine. Other healthy habits — such as drinking enough water, eating a well-balanced diet, and getting enough sleep every night — also contribute to glowing, smooth skin. Once you’ve got your skincare routine on lockdown, try incorporating these other habits into your daily routine to give your skin even more of a boost.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/what-is-glycolic-acid-and-how-is-it-used/,"By sulit.photos / Shutterstock.com
Glycolic acid has become one of the trendiest ingredients in skincare, but there’s still some confusion about what benefits it provides and how it’s actually used. In this quick primer, we’re covering what glycolic acid is and why you should use it, how you can incorporate this face exfoliator into your skincare routine and what skin types are most compatible with glycolic acid.
What is glycolic acid?
Glycolic acid is a member of the alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) family. AHAs are chemical exfoliants that are derived from milk or sugar origins. Chemical exfoliants work to exfoliate your skin by dissolving the chemical bonds that hold dead skin cells together (vs. physical exfoliants that scrub away the dead skin cells). While they might sound intimidating, chemical exfoliants such as glycolic acid are one of the safest and most effective ways to exfoliate your skin on a regular basis.
What are the benefits of glycolic acid?
One of the reasons for glycolic acid’s popularity is that it offers many benefits besides just effective exfoliation. By clearing away dead skin cells and helping to control oil production, glycolic acid can help to reduce acne breakouts. Glycolic acid also encourages your skin to produce more skin cells and more collagen, which can help minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Finally, glycolic acid also promotes more even skin tone and may help with hyperpigmentation, melasma and related conditions.

How is glycolic acid used?
Most people enjoy using glycolic acid in either a face peel or a leave-on treatment for the best exfoliating results. However, in the past few years, glycolic acid has become an extremely popular ingredient in skincare, so you can now find glycolic acid in facial cleansers, toners, serums, masks and more. There are even glycolic acid body lotions available if you want to treat the rest of your body as well as your face.
Always use glycolic acid products at night since they can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. You should also wear sunscreen during the day to protect your skin from potential UV exposure. Since glycolic acid is very strong, try using it only once per week and then potentially increasing the frequency to two to three times per week if your skin seems to need it. Keep it away from your eyes and from any cuts, abrasions or open sores on the skin.

How strong is glycolic acid?
Out of the most commonly used AHAs in skincare, glycolic acid has the smallest molecular size, which means that it’s actually one of the most powerful skincare acids you can use. The smaller the acid molecule, the more deeply it can penetrate your dead skin cells, resulting in more effective exfoliation. Because glycolic acid is so strong, you will rarely find leave-on products that contain more than 10 percent glycolic acid, while temporary peels may use up to 30 percent glycolic acid.
Note that the percentage of glycolic acid in a product is very important. Sometimes, skincare products will include a very tiny amount of an acid like glycolic acid to act as a pH balancer for other ingredients. Such a small amount of acid will not have the exfoliating properties that glycolic acid is known for because it’s just there to make the mixture more stable.
For best results, prioritize glycolic acids from brands that disclose the percentages on the label. You’ll want to look for a product that contains between five and 10 percent glycolic acid.

Try Our Glycolic Acid Body Lotion
Who should try glycolic acid?
Because of its many benefits, glycolic acid is a great fit for several different skin types, most especially oily skin, combination skin and normal skin. If you have tried gentler chemical exfoliants — such as mandelic acid and lactic acid — with minimal results, then moving up to glycolic acid might be just what your skin needs.
However, due to its strength, glycolic acid is not a good fit for dry skin or sensitive skin. This particular AHA tends to be too stripping and irritating for these skin types. To start off, try a gentler AHA with a lower percentage instead, and then you can potentially look at branching into glycolic acid if your skin tolerates chemical exfoliation well.
At Lancer Skincare, we offer simple yet effective 3-step skincare regimens designed by celebrity dermatologist Dr. Harold Lancer. All of our products, including our glycolic acid peels, ship for free and come with a 30-day money back guarantee so you can buy with confidence.

What Is Glycolic Acid and How Is It Used? was last modified:  February 7th, 2023 by [email protected]",What Is Glycolic Acid and How Is It Used?,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/woman-applying-face-serum.jpg
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/can-you-use-glycolic-acid-with-retinol-your-questions-answered/,"By Alex and Maria photo / Shutterstock.com
Both glycolic acid and retinol are potent skincare multitasking agents that offer lots of benefits in a single package. This begs the question: Are these ingredients too powerful to be used together? In this guide, we’re taking a look at why you might want to include both glycolic acid face peels and retinol in your skincare routine, and whether or not you can use both of these ingredients together.
What Is Glycolic Acid?
Glycolic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid derived from sugar cane. Glycolic acid is a chemical face exfoliator that helps to dissolve the bonds between dead skin cells. Glycolic acid offers many benefits, including more even skin tone and texture, better oil control, reduced acne breakouts and faster skin cell turnover.
Glycolic acid comes in many different forms and concentrations — from daily face washes to monthly face peels to glycolic acid body lotions. Many people like to use glycolic acid in a leave-on treatment that they apply one to three times weekly, depending on how often their skin needs it.

What Is Retinol?
Retinols are a subcategory of retinoids, which are all derived from vitamin A. Retinols are not as potent and are generally available over the counter, while retinoids are stronger and generally only available through a prescription from a dermatologist. Retinoids promote collagen growth, which helps to prevent and reduce the appearance of wrinkles and also to lighten dark spots and control acne.
Retinols are typically sold in a serum form, but you may find the ingredient incorporated into other products, such as body lotions, as well. Retinols can be sensitizing and drying to the skin, so you should start by applying it once per week underneath moisturizer and then work up to increasing the frequency to every other day.

Can You Use Glycolic Acid with Retinol?
Once upon a time, you might have been cautioned against using retinol and glycolic acid together in your 3-step skincare routine. Now, research has shown that alternating glycolic acid and retinol can be more beneficial than using one or the other exclusively. That’s because retinol speeds up skin cell turnover, while glycolic acid takes care of the extra dead skin cells. In fact, if you use retinol without some kind of exfoliator, you might eventually find yourself with a lot of dry, dead skin cells on your face — and nobody wants that.
However, it’s generally not a good idea to use glycolic acid and retinol in the same routine since they are both very strong ingredients and applying them to your face at the same time can lead to irritation. Furthermore, both retinol and glycolic acid should be used at night because they make your skin more sensitive to the sun. This means that it’s best to alternate your glycolic acid with your retinol in your nighttime routine (don’t put one on in the morning and another at night, in other words).

Glycolic Acid vs. Retinol: Which to Get Started with?
If you’re not currently using either glycolic acid or retinol, then choose only one to introduce at a time. If you try to use both glycolic acid and retinol without first building your skin’s tolerance, then you might accidentally damage your skin barrier.
You should start with glycolic acid if you are currently struggling with oil control, clogged pores and/or dry patches of dead skin cells. Glycolic acid is also a better starter product for people with sensitive skin because it is less sensitizing than retinol. On the other hand, you should start with retinol if you are currently focused on treating signs of aging, sun damage and/or acne.
Keep in mind that both glycolic acid and retinol are available in many different strengths. If you are just beginning your skincare journey, seek out gentler products with lower concentrations of these powerful ingredients. As your skin gets used to them, you can graduate to higher percentages of these ingredients and/or use them at a higher frequency. Watch out for signs of irritation and don’t be afraid to back off if you notice your skin barrier looking stressed.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/how-often-should-you-exfoliate/,"Exfoliating is one of the key steps to a weekly skincare routine, but you have to be careful with how much you exfoliate. If you don’t do it enough, then you won’t see the benefits — but if you do it too often, you’ll end up with redness, irritation, and a damaged skin barrier. So how are you supposed to know how often you should exfoliate with a face peel? In this ultimate guide, we’re exploring how often you should exfoliate, how to choose the perfect exfoliating product for your skin, how to get started exfoliating at home for the first time, and more. Here’s everything you need to know about exfoliating your face and body to reveal smooth, glowing skin all year round:

How often should you exfoliate?
How often you should exfoliate depends on a variety of factors, including your personal skin type, the current weather and climate, other skincare products that you are using, and more. Here are some general guidelines for how often various skin types can consider exfoliating:

Sensitive and/or skin: One to two times a week to prevent over-drying the skin
Normal or combination skin: Two to three times a week; so roughly every other day
Oily skin: Anywhere between three to seven times a week depending on what products they use

Certain exfoliating products are designed to be used more frequently than others. For example, some face washes use such a low percentage of alcohol that they are suitable for people with oily skin to use every day. Meanwhile, more intensive wash-off peels should only be used weekly or every other week. It will probably take some trial and error to discover how often you should use a particular exfoliating product with your particular skin type. The climate and weather will also affect how often you can safely exfoliate. Most people can tolerate more frequent exfoliation during the summer, but need to cut back in the winter in order to avoid over-drying their skin. People living in humid climates can also typically exfoliate more frequently than people living in dry climates.

What exfoliating products can you choose from?
There are many possible kinds of exfoliating products that you can choose from in order to suit your skin’s needs. Exfoliating products typically fall into two broad categories: physical and chemical. Physical scrubs use small particles to abrade away dead skin cells. Chemical exfoliators use alpha hydroxy and beta hydroxy acids to dissolve the bonds between dead skin cells so that you can wash them away. You can also get combination face exfoliators that combine physical and chemical actives for a truly effective exfoliation experience. You can find both physical and chemical exfoliating actives in many different formulations, including:


Facial cleansers: These are designed for oil control and gentle everyday exfoliation. They are applied to the skin just like a regular facial cleanser and then washed off.
Toners: These leave-on treatments offer a thin texture that soaks in quickly. They may be intended for daily oil control or to provide deeper exfoliating effects two to three times a week.
Serums: These leave-on treatments are typically thicker in texture than toners and also more effective. They are designed to be used two to three times a week in most cases.
Masks and peels: These more intensive wash-off treatments are designed to be used once a week or every other week as needed to provide deeper exfoliation.
Scrubs: These wash-off treatments function similarly to masks but provide even more exfoliation.

When choosing what exfoliating products to use, it’s usually best to start with just one, especially if you are new to exfoliating or have sensitive skin. Doubling up on different products — for instance, following up an exfoliating wash with an exfoliating toner — can strip the skin of necessary oils and damage your skin barrier. Even some products that don’t specifically bill themselves as “exfoliating” may still contain acids, so check the label before applying a new product to your face.
How should you get started with exfoliating?
There are so many exfoliating products on the market now that it can be overwhelming to decide where to get started with exfoliating for the first time. If you are new to exfoliating, we recommend picking one single exfoliating product to start off. Toner and serums are a great place to start since they are typically less intense than masks and scrubs, and many people already have a face wash they are using.
If you are mostly looking at chemical exfoliants, look for a toner or serum with a lower percentage of acid to reduce the chances of stressing out your skin. If you have sensitive skin, you might also wish to seek out acids that have a reputation for being more gentle, such as mandelic and lactic acid. Before applying the exfoliating product, remove all your makeup and wash your face with a gentle cleanser. Pat it completely dry, and then apply the exfoliating product to your skin as directed. Follow a leave-on treatment with hydrating serums if you’d like, and then seal everything in with an anti-aging moisturizer.

Leave a wash-off treatment on your skin for no longer than the time listed on the instructions. These treatments are typically more intense, so many people have success with leaving one on for a minute or two at a time to get started, and then slowly increasing their tolerance until they can leave it on for the full amount of time. It’s normal to experience some mild stinging or tingling when you first apply the exfoliating product, and that will usually fade within a few minutes. However, a strong sensation of burning or pain is not normal; nor is unusual redness or splotches. You should immediately wash off the exfoliator if you experience any of these symptoms or think that you might be having an allergic reaction.
Start by exfoliating once a week to start. If that goes well, step it up to twice a week. You can eventually go up to three times a week if you think you need it. Once your skin adjusts to a regular exfoliation practice, you can consider incorporating a weekly or bimonthly mask for deeper exfoliation. People with exfoliation might also want to consider switching to a daily face wash or toner for oil control benefits.
What is the best time of day to exfoliate?
Once again, the answer to this question depends on your skin. Some people with very oily skin like to start off the day with an exfoliating wash or toner to help control shine until they get home. However, most people prefer to do stronger leave-on treatments and wash-off peels at night. This is because exfoliating makes your skin more sensitive to the sun, and doing it at night gives your skin time to recover without being immediately exposed to the sun.
Regardless of what time of day you exfoliate your face, you should always wear an SPF of 30 or higher during the day. While you should already be wearing sunscreen every day anyway, it’s especially important if you have a regular exfoliating practice since that makes you more sensitive to the sun and increases your likelihood of burning. Regular SPF use will ensure that you can continue to reap the benefits of regular exfoliation while minimizing your risk of side effects.

What are the signs of under- and over-exfoliating?
If you don’t exfoliate your skin enough, then your skin will start to look dull and may develop a rough texture. People who are acne prone may also develop clogged pores or breakouts as their pores become congested from the build-up of dead skin cells. Other skincare products might also be less effective due to increased difficulty in penetrating that top layer of dead skin cells.
If you exfoliate too much, your face will start to feel dry and tight, can develop redness and irritation, and may even start flaking. Excessive exfoliation can lead to more skin problems, including eczema, microtears, broken capillaries, infection, and more. Be extra cautious of over-exfoliating if you have sensitive or dry skin, which is more vulnerable to over-exfoliation.

What should you do if you have over-exfoliated?
If you are experiencing any signs of over-exfoliating, stop using all exfoliating products to give your skin a break and see how it does. You should also avoid putting exfoliating products in or around any cuts, scrapes, infections, and other openings in the skin. This will irritate your skin, delay the healing process, and potentially lead to scarring or other complications.
In addition to stopping your exfoliating products, you should also avoid foaming facial cleansers, retinol serums, and other skincare products that can have a drying effect on the skin. Instead, focus on using a mild cleanser and fragrance-free moisturizer to encourage your skin barrier to repair itself and avoid further irritation. If you have areas that are very red or raw, spot treat them with Aquaphor, aloe gel, hydrocortisone cream, or another soothing product.
Depending on how much you have damaged your skin barrier, it can take your face anywhere from a few days to an entire skin cycle (about a month) to repair itself. It’s really important not to start exfoliating your skin again until you are sure it’s entirely recovered. You will also need to slowly phase in your exfoliating once you start them up again to avoid stressing your skin out again.

What about exfoliating the body?
Exfoliating the face gets a lot of attention, but exfoliating the body can be equally beneficial. There are many different products that you can use for exfoliating the body, including wash cloths, mitts, brushes, scrubs, body washes, and lotions. Just as with the face, exfoliating the body two to three times a week is a good goal to aim for.
Exfoliating during or after a shower is a great idea. Not only does the hot water soften your skin and open up your pores, but the water will also wash away dead skin cells as you exfoliate. Try to stand in the shower for at least five minutes or soak in the bath for 10 minutes before exfoliating to ensure that your skin is soft enough.
If your skin is sensitive, a wash cloth will be softer than a brush or scrubber while still providing an exfoliating effect. You may wish to pair it with a gentle exfoliating body wash if the wash cloth alone isn’t cutting it. Be sure to follow it up with a moisturizer to help nourish your skin after exfoliating and prevent moisture loss. You can also try a leave-on exfoliating lotion, which can have an exfoliating effect that runs from mild to intense based on what percentage of AHAs or BHAs they contain.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/how-to-remove-makeup-the-right-way/,"Removing makeup, sunscreen, and other stubborn cosmetic products is an essential first step to any nighttime skin routine. While many people think that they know how to remove makeup the right way, the truth is that many of them haven’t been taught how to remove makeup properly (and, no, simply rubbing your facial cleanser on your face will not remove your waterproof mascara and full coverage foundation). To help you out, we’ve compiled an ultimate guide that explains the different types of makeup you need to know about and how to remove makeup the right way. Then we’ll dive into why removing makeup matters and finish up with a look at the most common makeup removal mistakes that we see. Without further ado, here’s what you need to know about removing makeup:
Types of Makeup Removers
The specifics of how you will remove makeup will depend on the exact type of makeup remover you choose. Here are the top five types of makeup removers that you need to know about:
Micellar water
Micellar water refers to a water-based product that has tiny droplets of cleansing oils (a.k.a. micelles) suspended in the liquid. To use a micellar water, fully saturate a flat cotton pad, and then gently rub it along your face to remove the makeup.  Micellar water is very gentle and suitable for all skin types, which is one of the reasons why it is so popular. Micellar water can remove skincare products, non-water-resistant sunscreens, and light makeup, but typically isn’t strong enough to tackle waterproof cosmetic products like mascara and foundation.

Eye makeup remover
Eye makeup removers are oil-heavy liquid products that are specifically designed to remove eyeshadow, mascara, lipstick, and other cosmetics products that are highly pigmented and difficult to remove. To use an eye makeup remover, fully saturate a flat cotton pad, and then hold it on the area where you wish to remove the makeup. While eye makeup removers are great for certain areas of the face, most people should avoid using them on their entire complexion, as the oil-heavy formula can clog pores and lead to breakouts.
Cleansing oil
Cleansing oils are another type of liquid makeup remover. Cleansing oils are typically thinner in consistency than eye makeup removers and are designed to be rubbed on a dry face directly, rather than applied to a cotton pad first. Some cleansing oils are strong enough to remove waterproof makeup and some are not; check the description and reviews before purchasing if you tend to wear a lot of makeup.
Cleansing balm
Cleansing balms usually come in a tub and feature a solid balm product that breaks down into an oil when you rub it between your hands. Once you have liquified the cleansing balm, rub it directly on your dry face until your makeup fully breaks down. Cleansing balms are very nourishing, making them a great pick for dry skin or the winter months. Cleansing balms are also typically designed to remove all kinds of makeup and skincare products.
Makeup wipes
Makeup wipes are sheets soaked in makeup removing chemicals. They are designed to be rubbed directly on the face to transfer the makeup to the wipe. Certain wipes can leave makeup and chemical residue behind on your face, which can lead to irritation, clogged pores, and breakouts. Make sure to check the ingredients to ensure that you are getting skin-friendly makeup remover wipes, such as those sold by Lancer Skincare.

How to Remove Makeup the Right Way
Now that we’ve gotten up to speed on the different types of makeup removers, we can talk about how to remove your makeup the right way. First of all, you should always apply makeup removers to dry skin. This is because almost all makeup removers are made with some kind of oil component in order to break down makeup. If your face is already wet, the water will repel the makeup remover and lead to a less effective cleanse.
If you are using a micellar water or an eye makeup remover, soak a flat cotton pad until it is fully saturated with the products. For micellar water, gently wipe the pad across the face to remove sunscreen and makeup. For eye makeup remover, gently hold it over one eye for at least 60 seconds, and then switch to the other eye; finish by swiping it across your lips if necessary. In both cases, it may take more than one cotton pad for you to get all the makeup off.
If you are using a cleansing oil, simply squirt a couple pumps into your hand, and then gently massage it all over your face and neck. If you are using a cleansing balm, scoop out a quarter-sized amount and rub it between your palms, and then gently massage it all over your face and neck as well. If you are wearing a lot of makeup, then you may wish to let your makeup remover sit on your face to make sure that it fully breaks down all the product on your face. Don’t neglect the edges of your face, and always push your hair back so you can cleanse around your hairline, ears, and jaw to remove the last traces of makeup.
Once you are satisfied that all your makeup has been removed, rinse your face or get into the shower or bath. Always follow up a makeup remover with a facial cleanser of your choice to ensure that you are removing the last traces of product from your face. Be sure to include anti-aging moisturizers and other hydrating products in your nighttime skin routine to nourish your skin after the makeup removal process.

Why Removing Makeup Is Important
At this point, you may be wondering: Why is it such a big deal to remove my makeup at night? If you’re dedicated to sleeping in your makeup, here are five unintended side effects that can happen when you don’t remove your makeup:
It leaves your complexion looking dull.
The makeup that left you looking fresh and dewy last night won’t look so good after you’ve slept in it. Old makeup tends to settle into fine lines and pores, making you look older and tired. In many cases, you’ll need to remove the makeup and reapply it in the morning anyway, because it’s rare to get through a night of sleep with your face intact.
It can clog pores and increase breakouts.
Makeup can embed itself in your pores overnight, making them look bigger and leading to whiteheads and blackheads. Makeup can also create a seal that traps oil in your skin, clogging your pores and contributing to acne breakouts. Certain makeup products may even contain comedogenic ingredients that are already known for worsening breakouts, and sleeping in it will just increase your risk of breakouts even further.
It can throw off your skin’s oil balance.
Everyone’s skin has a certain equilibrium of oil production, and sleeping in your makeup can throw it off. If your makeup is more matte, it can make your skin look dull and dehydrated. On the other hand, if your makeup is more dewy, it will make your face look super shiny. If you sleep in your makeup frequently, it can throw off your skin’s oil production in the long term and have farther-reaching effects on your skin.
It makes other skincare products less effective.
Skincare products certainly aren’t designed to penetrate a full face of makeup. If you only have lingering traces of makeup on your skin, it will make your other products less effective than they could be. If you’re paying for skincare that you hope will make a difference in your skin, then removing all your makeup before applying your skincare will ensure that your skincare is as effective as possible.
It will stain your pillowcases and sheets.
Makeup can be really difficult to get out of fabric, especially if you wear waterproof cosmetic products. If you sleep in your makeup, then you will almost certainly get it all over your pillowcases and sheets, which can permanently stain them beyond recognition. Removing your makeup every night will keep your towels, sheets, pillowcases, and other linens looking nearly brand new.

Common Makeup Removal Mistakes
Removing makeup seems like a simple enough process, but there are still better ways to do it than others. Here are the top five makeup removal mistakes that we see:
Not letting the products sit long enough
If you’re rubbing your face really hard to try to break up the makeup on your skin, consider letting the makeup remover sit on your face for a couple minutes before you rinse it off. In many cases, agitating the product around with your hands only provides marginal benefits, and the real reason why your makeup remover isn’t taking off your makeup is because you’re not letting it sit long enough. Don’t be afraid to let it rest on your face for a few minutes while you brush your teeth and floss. You’ll be surprised at how much more effective your makeup removal becomes!
Rubbing your skin too hard
On a similar note, rubbing or tugging the skin too hard is another common mistake that we see often with makeup removers. Rubbing the skin vigorously can irritate it and even cause microtears. If you have to rub the makeup remover really hard to remove the product on your face, then you’re either not letting it sit for long enough or you’re using the wrong makeup removal products for your needs (see below).

Choosing the wrong makeup removal product
Not all makeup removers are created equal. A micellar water is great for removing a light layer of BB cream, but it might not put a dent in a full face of waterproof foundation. If you feel like your makeup remover isn’t doing its job, and you’ve tried all the other tips, consider whether or not you need to switch to a different type of makeup remover to get a more effective cleanse.
Using a cleanser that isn’t meant for makeup removal
Facial cleansers are the foundation of any skincare routine, but they’re not meant to remove makeup. If you’ve just been putting a facial cleanser right on your face, without removing your makeup first, then you’re probably not getting a very effective cleanse. Using a makeup remover first will allow your facial cleanser to do what it’s supposed to do and result in a more pleasant and effective cleansing experience.
If you’re looking for high-quality makeup remover wipes, be sure to grab a pack from our Lancer Skincare online store! We also offer a whole range of nourishing skincare products that create the perfect followup routine after makeup removal, including facial cleansers and moisturizers. All of our products feature tried-and-true ingredients and are backed by our 100% satisfaction guarantee.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/why-is-my-skin-so-dry-even-when-i-moisturize/,"Dry skin is a relatively common condition, especially in the winter. Proper treatment is key for stopping dry skin from getting worse and preventing cracking, peeling, and other side effects. However, sometimes you will find that your skin is dry even when you moisturize, and it can be hard to discern the exact cause.
If your skin is dry no matter what anti-aging moisturizer you try, you’ve come to the right place. In this guide, we break down 16 possible reasons why your skin might be dry despite your best efforts. Keep in mind that there is rarely one single cause, and that most dry skin will be caused by multiple factors working together to dry out your skin. Without further ado, here are 16 reasons why your skin might be dry even if you are moisturizing regularly:
You’re over-cleansing, or using the wrong cleanser.
Out of your entire skin routine routine, cleansing is the step that has the potential to be the most stripping and drying. If you are cleansing too often, that can lead to dry skin no matter how much moisturizer you slather on. For instance, if you’re washing your face in the morning and at night, try only doing it once a day and just rinsing it with water the other time. You should also examine your cleansing for potentially drying ingredients such as sulfates and acids. Generally speaking, foaming cleansers will be more stripping while milk and cream cleansers are gentler on the skin, so the latter may be a better choice for you.
You use water that’s too hot.
We love a hot shower as much as the next person, but unfortunately hot water is very drying for your skin and hair. In fact, if you have been struggling with dry skin on your body as well as your face, then too-hot showers might be one of the culprits. Whether you are taking a shower or washing your face at the sink, the water should be lukewarm to warm, not hot to the touch. Also try to avoid hot tubs and other scenarios where you will be exposed to very hot water, especially for a long period of time.

You’re spending too much time in the water.
Even if your baths and showers are lukewarm, they might be drying out your skin if you tend to stay in them for a very long time. Ideally, your showers should last a maximum of 5-10 minutes, and you should only shower once a day if possible. If you spend a lot of time swimming in pools, ocean, lakes, and other bodies of water, that can also dry out your skin. Chlorinated water such as swimming pools will further exacerbate the effects, because chlorine strips the natural oils from your skin. If you are struggling with very dry skin, try minimizing your time in water to see if that helps to ease your symptoms.
Your skin has been exposed to chlorinated or hard water.
Even if you’ve been good about taking quick, lukewarm showers, your water might still be drying out your skin due to the chemicals it contains. Hard water has a lot of calcium and magnesium dissolved in it. The presence of these minerals means that the water is less effective at washing away soap, leaving residue behind on your skin and leading to dryness and irritation. You can get test strips to determine how hard your water is. If your home does have hard water, you can get filters to help remove the minerals from the water to lessen its effects on your skin.
You use products with a lot of fragrance.
We hate to break it to you, but all those perfumes and scented body products might be seriously irritating your skin. Fragrances are created by certain volatile chemicals reacting together, and the presence of these chemicals can irritate your skin. Denatured alcohol is also a common carrier for scents. Unfortunately, this type of alcohol is notoriously drying to the skin as well. If you have been struggling with dry skin, it’s worth switching to a fragrance-free skin routine to see if that helps with skin that is dry even after moisturizing.

Your moisturizer contains drying ingredients.
Reading the ingredient label carefully is important, because some moisturizers can contain ingredients that dry out your skin. Look for a fragrance-free moisturizer with a short ingredient list that is free of potential ingredients. If you need extra moisture, consider layering on a hydrated facial oil or mixing it into your lotion.
You’re applying your moisturizer at the wrong time.
To get the most benefit out of your moisturizer, you should be applying it twice a day: once in the morning and once in the evening; a.k.a. after each time you shower or wash your face. Ideally, you should apply your serums and then your moisturizer as soon as possible while your face is slightly damp. This will help to trap the water in your skin and help to combat dryness. If you wait even a couple of minutes, your face will dry out completely and your moisturizing products won’t be as effective.
You’re applying too much moisturizer.
Believe it or not, applying too much moisturizer can have adverse effects on your skin. That’s because using too much moisturizer or applying it too often can mess up your skin’s natural balance, smothering your skin and causing your skin to produce less oil than it should. Over time, this can reduce your oil production enough that it results in chronically dry skin. If you’ve been slathering your skin in moisturizer, try applying less or switching to a lighter product that won’t be as thick.

You exfoliate too often.
Exfoliating regularly can offer many benefits for your skin, including smoothing out texture, reducing acne blemishes, and clearing out clogged pores. However, over-exfoliating can have seriously negative side effects for your skin, such as drying out your skin and even damaging your skin barrier. If you have been exfoliating multiple times a week or using very harsh exfoliating products, it doesn’t matter how much moisturizer you put on — your skin will still be dry. Try cutting back on exfoliating, switching to gentler products, or even giving your skin a break entirely to see if that soothes your dry skin.
You don’t exfoliate often enough.
On the other hand, not exfoliating enough can also contribute to dry skin. This is because if you don’t exfoliate, the dead skin will build up on your face, resulting in dry patches and making it harder for your skincare products to work effectively. Some gentle exfoliation one to two times a week will help smooth out these rough patches and make it easy to apply an even layer of moisturizer. We recommend choosing lower concentrations of acids to reduce the risks of over-exfoliating and irritating your skin.
You live in a harsh, cold, dry climate.
Certain factors that cause dehydrated skin have nothing to do with you, and living in a harsh, dry, and/or cold climate is one of those. However, just because you live in one of these areas, it doesn’t mean you have to resign yourself to peeling, cracking skin. Try to minimize your time outdoors, especially when the weather is inclement, and cover up your skin with coats, hats, gloves, and scarves when you must go outside. Getting a humidifier for your home and/or office can also make a big difference by putting some moisture back into the air.

You’re not drinking enough water.
Hydration doesn’t just happen from the outside in; it also happens from the inside out. If you’re not drinking enough water, then your skin will still be dry even if you are applying a gallon of moisturizer a day. If drinking plain water doesn’t appeal to you, try caffeine-free herbal teas for hot beverages, or infusing cold water with fruits and vegetables to give it some flavor. Most people need between three to four liters of fluid a day, depending on how much they sweat and other factors.
You’re not getting enough nutrients.
Getting the proper amounts of nutrients is key for skin health. If you’re deficient in certain vitamins and minerals, that could be contributing to dry skin. Some of the most important nutrients for skin health include vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and zinc. Getting these nutrients naturally through your diet is usually the best course of action, but you might also need to look into taking some kind of supplement or vitamin if you can’t get them through food and drinks.
You have underlying health conditions.
Many different health conditions feature dry skin as a side effect. This is especially true for skin conditions such as eczema and dermatitis. However, it can also be a side effect of many different internal health conditions, including diabetes, thyroid disorders, renal failure, and HIV. If you are struggling with health issues, talk to your doctor about whether or not your dry skin could be related to any of them. In some cases, the dry skin will go away as the underlying causes are treated.
You are experiencing side effects of medications.
In some other cases, getting treatment for your medical conditions is what causes the dry skin. Numerous medications are known to dry out the skin, including blood pressure drugs, cholesterol medications, acne treatments, wrinkle creams, and antihistamines. In some cases, the effects are temporary as your skin adjusts to the medications, but in other situations the dryness will be ongoing. If you’re experiencing extremely dry skin, talk to your doctor about mitigating the side effects and potentially switching to another drug that might be less drying.

You are genetically predisposed to dry skin.
Certain factors, such as ethnicity and genetics, mean that certain people are more predisposed to dry skin than others. For instance, ethnicity plays a large role in how much water content your skin naturally contains and how fast water loss occurs. Aging is also a major contributing factor to dry skin: Oil production slows down as you age, and basically everyone has dry skin by age 60 or so. So if you feel like your skin has been getting drier as you age, it’s not just in your head — that really is happening.

You’ve heard that you should be wearing sunscreen every single day, but do you know why? In this guide, we’ll explore six must-know benefits of sunscreen and explain why anti-aging sunscreen must be part of your morning 3-step skincare routine no matter what.
Sunscreen lowers your risk of skin cancer.
Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer, but that doesn’t mean that it’s inevitable. In fact, wearing sunscreen every day has been shown to protect the skin against harmful UV rays and to reduce the wearer’s risk of skin cancer. According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, wearing an SPF 15 sunscreen every day can reduce your risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) by about 40 percent and lower your melanoma risk by 50 percent. Higher SPF ratings provide even more protection, further lowering your risk of skin cancer.
Sunscreen helps to prevent sunburn.
While cumulative UV damage to the skin can often go unseen for years, too much exposure to the sun at once usually results in a painful, unattractive sunburn that turns your whole face red. Wearing sunscreen and reapplying it will help to protect your skin from an unsightly sunburn and the painful side effects. Be sure to follow other sun protection best practices, including wearing sunglasses, covering up exposed skin with UPF clothing, avoiding the sun during the middle of the day, and staying in the shade whenever possible.

Sunscreen protects against premature aging.
Everyone develops fine lines and wrinkles eventually due to breakdown in the collagen and elastin in their skin as they age. However, cumulative damage from UV rays can greatly hasten this process, leading to premature signs of aging. Wearing long-lasting sunscreen every day — even if it’s cloudy or you’re sitting indoors — will help to protect against this cumulative damage and to guard against signs of premature aging. For the most anti-aging protection, apply the sunscreen to all exposed skin, including your neck and chest, as opposed to just your face. It’s never too late to start protecting against signs of premature aging by wearing sunscreen.
Sunscreen reduces inflammation and redness.
If you’ve been struggling with rosacea, inflammation, or red patches on your skin, not wearing sunscreen might be contributing to the problem. That’s because sun exposure can cause or worsen redness even if you don’t officially get sunburned. Sun exposure can also exacerbate inflammation from cuts, acne lesions, and other skin conditions. Wearing sunscreen helps to protect against the sun and prevent it from worsening these conditions. If you’re struggling with a lot of redness and inflammation, be sure to also wear sunglasses and a wide brimmed hat and stay out of the sun as much as possible.

Sunscreen helps to prevent hyperpigmentation.
Hyperpigmentation refers to darker patches of skin caused by excess melanin production. This can take the form of melasma, sun sports, or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and all of them are worsened by exposure to UV rays. Wearing a daily sunscreen will help to prevent existing hyperpigmentation from getting worse as well as reduce the chances that new hyperpigmentation spots will form. Wearing sunscreen may also help existing hyperpigmentation to fade faster than it would otherwise. This is because sun exposure stimulates melanin production in the skin, which contributes to the formation of hyperpigmentation.
Sunscreen can act as a cosmetic product.
Unlike makeup, the primary benefit of sunscreen should never be cosmetics—and, no, makeup that includes an SPF rating will not offer enough protection on its own. However, thanks to advances in formulations, some sunscreens now offer some minor cosmetic benefits that enhance the appearance of your skin in addition to protecting against sun damage. For instance, tinted sunscreens help to even out your skin tone, while silicone-based sunscreens help to blur the appearance of large pores and act as a primer for foundation. This means that wearing sunscreen can help you look good immediately as well as in the future.
You won’t realize all the benefits of sunscreens if you don’t find a formulation that you’re willing to wear every single day. At Lancer Skincare, we offer several different highly wearable anti-aging sunscreen formulations that you will look forward to wearing every day. Like all Lancer Skincare products, our sunscreens come with a 100% satisfaction guarantee and ship free within the U.S., no order minimum needed. Order today to start protecting your skin from the sun!

Glycolic acid offers many benefits for the skin, including exfoliating the skin to remove dead skin cells, evening out pigmentation, clearing blocked pores, stimulating skin cell turnover, reducing the appearance of fine lines, and more. While you can get deep glycolic acid peels at a dermatologist or aesthetician office, they are also available in over-the-counter formulation that you can do at home. Here’s everything you need to know about choosing and applying a glycolic acid peel at home:
Shop Acid Face Peels from Lancer Skincare
How to Choose an At-Home Glycolic Acid Peel
There are two main types of at-home glycolic acid peels: leave-on overnight treatments and wash-off treatments. The leave-on treatments typically feature a lower percentage of glycolic acid because they are meant to be left on the skin for a longer period of time; they usually top out around 10% glycolic acid. Wash-off treatments often have around 25-30% glycolic acid and can go as high as 70%.
We recommend sticking to the lower end of those percentages if you are new to chemical peels, have sensitive skin, are using a retinoid, or have a darker skin tone. You should always buy your chemical peel from a trusted brand, such as Lancer Skincare, to ensure that you are getting the quality formulation that you have been promised.
Leave-on face peels are usually more gentle on the skin and can be used up to two to three nights a week once you build up your tolerance. Wash-off treatments are stronger and should not be used more than once a week, and most people only use them every other week. Using an at-home chemical peel too frequently can dry out your skin and harm your skin barrier, so start slowly and gradually build up your tolerance for chemical peels.

Glycolic acid is one of the more powerful over-the-counter exfoliating acids available, which is why it’s so popular for at-home peels. If you struggle with acne, you might also want to look into salicylic acid peels or peels that combine glycolic and salicylic acid. And if you have very sensitive skin and have never done a chemical peel before, you might enjoy using a gentler acid such as lactic acid or mandelic acid to start off.

How to Do a Glycolic Acid Peel at Home
Regardless of whether you choose a leave-on peel or a wash-off treatment, you should begin the process by removing all your makeup and washing your face with a gentle, non-stripping cleanser. Pat your face with a clean towel until it is completely dry, and then grab your glycolic acid peel of choice.
If you are doing a leave-on overnight treatment, that should be the very first serum you apply so it goes directly on top of the skin. Otherwise the glycolic acid will have to get through numerous layers of product in order to reach your skin, which will make the chemical peel less effective. Follow up the glycolic acid with moisturizer to prevent moisture loss while the peel does its work overnight.

For a wash-off peel, apply a thin, even layer all over your face and jawline and leave it on for no more than the time specified in the instructions. If you are new to chemical peels, we recommend cutting the time even shorter to avoid compromising your skin barrier. Some mild tingling or stinging is normal, but if your face starts hurting you should wash off the peel regardless of how much time has passed. Once your face is clean and dry, follow up the peel with hydrating serums and a moisturizer.
Always avoid applying any kind of chemical exfoliating to the eye area as well as the lips. Also be careful with applying exfoliators to your neck — the neck has fewer oil glands than your face, so applying a chemical exfoliator to the skin there can really dry it out. Be diligent about wearing your daily sunscreen, especially in the days following a chemical peel when your face will be more sensitive to sun damage.

By now, you probably know that a chemical peel exfoliates your face. But you may be wondering how exactly it accomplishes that exfoliation, especially when you aren’t physically scrubbing at the skin? In this guide, we’ll dive into the science of chemical face peels and explain what your options are when it comes to chemical exfoliation.
What Does a Chemical Peel Do to Your Face?
The answer to “what does a chemical peel do to your face?” lies in the science of skin cells. The top layer of your skin is called the epidermis, and it constantly sheds dead skin cells. In fact, you lose about 30,000 to 40,000 dead skin cells off the surface of your skin every minute of every day. This means that your top layer of skin completely replaces itself every two to four weeks. That’s a lot of dead skin cells!
Most of these dead skin cells wash away in the shower, but some of them stay behind, stuck to the rest of your skin with molecular level bonds that act like glue. This can lead to clogged pores, dry patches, flakes, rough texture, and other unpleasant side effects. Getting a chemical peel will help to remove these dead skin cells faster, revealing smooth, glowing skin underneath.
Chemical peels work to get rid of these dead skin cells by temporarily changing the pH of your skin in a way that allows these bonds to dissolve. Your skin normally has a pH of around 5.5, while a chemical peel temporarily lowers it to a pH of around 3.8. This temporary rise in acidity loosens the cells that hold dead skin cells onto the healthy ones, allowing them to be washed away and promoting the growth of new skin cells.

What Chemical Peel Options Do You Have?
There are many different kinds of acids used in chemical peels, as well as various combinations thereof. These fall into two different categories: alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs). Popular AHAs include glycolic acid, lactic acid, mandelic acid, and more. Popular BHAs include salicylic acid and sometimes citric acid as well. AHAs are used to address a wide range of conditions, including enlarged pores, fine lines, uneven skin tone, mild hyperpigmentation, and more. BHAs are mostly used to address acne as well as sun damage. Sometimes you can find chemical peels that combine AHAs and BHAs together, so you can get the benefits of both types of acids.
Professional acid face peels are available in dermatologist and aesthetician offices and come in three different levels of strengths: light, medium, and deep. Light chemical peels require little to no downtime and only remove cells from the top layer of skin. Medium chemical peels remove skin cells from both the epidermis and the top of the dermis; recovery can take up to a week and may require downtime. Deep chemical peels remove even more layers of skin cells and typically require a pre-treatment routine as well as significant downtime.
You can also get at-home chemical peel products like those offered by Lancer Skincare. These at-home glycolic acid peels are available in milder leave-on formulations as well as stronger wash-off treatments. They can be used between one to three times a week depending on the formulation and your skin’s tolerance for exfoliation.

What Are the Benefits of Chemical Peels?
Chemical peels can be used to address many different skin conditions. At-home or light chemical peels are best for removing dry or flaking patches, smoothing out skin texture, addressing mild acne, and mitigating fine wrinkles. Medium chemical peels can help to treat skin discoloration, age spots, acne scarring, and fine to moderate wrinkles. Deep chemical peels are used for more severe acne scarring, blotchy or sun damaged skin, and moderate wrinkles.
Your dermatologist will be able to tell you whether or not a chemical peel can address your skincare concerns, and, if so, what type of acid and level of peel would be most appropriate for you. But you don’t have to go to an aesthetician office to reap the benefits of a chemical peel — you can start doing them at home with skincare products like those offered by Lancer Skincare.

You should exfoliate your face daily, but remember to always use products designed specifically for your skin type.
If you’re looking for a great way to prevent clogged pores and brighten up a dull complexion, you need to get comfortable with exfoliating your face. Exfoliating is the practice of resurfacing the skin with either a physical or chemical exfoliator to get rid of the dead skin cells that prevent your skin from looking radiant. 
At Lancer, we call exfoliating “polishing” because it uncovers a layer of glowing beauty, just like when you polish a tarnished piece of silver or gold until it shines.
Why Exfoliating Is Important
What, exactly, does exfoliation do? Skin cell turnover, or the process of the skin regenerating new cells, is key to healthy skin. When dead skin cells accumulate on the surface of your skin, cell turnover rate is stalled, which can cause clogged pores, premature signs of aging and dullness of the complexion.
Exfoliating purges the pores of old skin cells that cause blemishes and also prepares the skin so it can better absorb medications, cleansers and moisturizers. That’s why we recommend starting your daily skin care routine with a polish. It helps ensure that your skin is prepped for steps two and three — your facial cleanser and moisturizer.
Should You Exfoliate Your Face Every Day?
We recommend exfoliating your face every day, but with one caveat: only use products that suit your skin type. Because it’s quite literally removing the top layer of skin, exfoliating can be damaging to sensitive, dry or irritated skin types. Regardless of your skin type, following up with a hydrating anti-aging moisturizer is critical to ensuring that your skin stays healthy and radiant post-exfoliation.
Exfoliating is the first step in The Lancer Method for younger skin. All of our polishes are manual exfoliators, meaning they use particles rather than chemicals to physically slough away that top layer of skin. With the Lancer Method, we use ultra-fine magnesium oxide quartz crystals to abrade the skin safely and gently. These are uniform in shape and size, ensuring that dead skin cells fall away and leave behind an even, glowing complexion.
The Lancer Method is unique from other skin care routines with exfoliation because each set is formulated for a specific skin type. We have special formulas designed specifically for those with normal to combination skin, sensitive or dehydrated skin and oily or congested skin. Choose the version that most closely matches your skin type for the best results.
How Often Should You Exfoliate Your Body?
Now that you know you should exfoliate your face every day, you may be wondering if the same logic applies to the body. Indeed, it does! You should exfoliate your body every day in the shower or bathtub using a physical or chemical exfoliator.
Body scrubs and chemical exfoliators work the same way that facial ones do — by removing the top layer of skin to reveal a new layer beneath. This is especially important on the knees, elbows, hands and feet, where skin is thicker and rougher.

We recommend exfoliating the body once a day in the shower using The Method: Body Polish. This product uses both physical and chemical exfoliants to scrub away the dull, dead layers of skin on your arms, legs, torso and feet to leave behind silky smooth, soft skin. 
This will help improve skin texture, prepare your skin for other treatments, help prevent body acne and leave skin looking visibly renewed.
Daily Exfoliation Is Best
As long as you’re using gentle products formulated for your unique skin type and you always follow up with a hydrating moisturizer, you will be able to reap the benefits of daily exfoliation without drying out or damaging your skin. Use The Method 3-Step Sets to get everything you need to exfoliate, cleanse and moisturize in a way that suits your skin type.

At Lancer Dermatology, patients have been booking their consultations early to get their skin ready for the holiday season. Dr. Lancer notes that a common skin concern amongst patients today is hyperpigmentation or discoloration, commonly found along the forehead and cheeks. Yes, some of us have been spending a little too much time in the sun, but what about those of us that work from home and still have it? You’re still getting a good amount of light from your windows, computer screen and cell phone so unfortunately, you’re not safe from dark spot formation. Hyperpigmentation can also be genetic or brought on by a variety of environmental stressors.

To address this skin concern and effectively fade stubborn discoloration, Dr. Lancer created Instant Brightening Booster, a new topical designed to brighten, exfoliate and even skin tone with anti-aging benefits. So, what’s in this product you might ask. The ingredients list includes 30% Vitamin C, Turmeric, Sunflower Seed Oil and Coconut & Glycerin Complex. Vitamin C and Turmeric are both powerful ingredients that help reduce pigmentation such as acne scars, sunspots and dark spots, giving the skin an even, radiant complexion. Sunflower Seed Oil provides antioxidant and anti-inflammatory protection to enhance skin’s health and barrier while Coconut & Glycerin Complex replenishes lipids to restore and smooth skin. With these ingredients, the treatment will not only fade existing discoloration, but will also help prevent new dark spots from forming.

In addition to creating uniformity and even skin tone, Instant Brightening Booster works its anti-aging magic by minimizing fine lines and wrinkles. Not only that, this product is effective on all skin types. That’s right – all skin types, and for both men and women. Because of the extremely high level of vitamin C, the formula is extremely potent, so all you need to do is use it once or twice a week, at night. Apply a thin layer to the face and neck after cleansing, avoiding the eye area. Afterward, leave it on and finish your nighttime routine with The Method: Nourish.
Don’t miss out on the product that could change your skin. Go for that even skin tone, get that radiant, brighter complexion and receive anti-aging benefits all at the same time.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/how-to-get-better-skin-while-you-sleep/,"Believe it or not, evenings are the best time to treat and restore the skin. Our skin cells regenerate in the evening and the skin absorbs nutrients from skincare products significantly better while we sleep. During the day, we come into contact with air pollution, sun damage, we sweat and we have makeup on, so applying products at night allows clean skin to focus on absorbing those beneficial ingredients without those every day interferences.
A Derm-Approved Evening Skincare Routine for Every Skin Type
While nightly skincare treatments may vary from person to person, Dr. Lancer gives his recommendations for anti-aging nighttime skincare routines that have been proven to be highly effective for every skin type. The Method 3-Step System of Polish, Cleanse and Nourish is the foundation of Lancer Skincare and is the key to jump start the skin’s transformation. The Method helps skin look younger as it exfoliates and cleans the skin, accelerates cell turnover and natural collagen regeneration and feeds skin essential nutrients while keeping it hydrated and smooth. Fine lines and wrinkles should also appear visibility reduced with consistent use and skin should appear firmer and lifted. Note – If you use Polish in the morning, you can skip it in your evening routine as once a day is recommended.
What Advanced Products Can Be Added to Make This Routine Even Better?
After getting accustomed to The Method, often times an active alpha hydroxy acid, vitamin c active or advanced retinol will be added to a skincare routine. “The usual skincare program will start with adding a vitamin c active product at night along with Nourish three times a week. You can slowly add an alpha hydroxy acid such as the Retexturizing Treatment approximately twice weekly, then after a few weeks see how the vitamin c active and the retexturizing alpha hydroxy acid interact in terms of improving complexion. After your skin gets acclimated to these products, you can slowly add in the 3rd active component – an advanced retinol.” – Dr. Lancer
With these products in mind, you can follow the schedule suggested below and see if it works for your skin.
Monday, Wednesday, Friday – Use Polish, Cleanse, Advanced C Radiance Treatment and Nourish in the morning. As skin gets used to Advanced C Radiance Treatment, you can use The Method with Advanced Retinol Treatment at night.
Tuesday & Thursday – Use Polish, Cleanse, Nourish in the morning. At Night, you can use Cleanse and add in the Retexturizing Treatment.
In addition to the skincare routine provided, it’s recommended that you add the Eye Contour Lifting Cream and Contour Décolleté into your skincare routine. Eye Contour Lifting Cream will reduce the appearance of puffiness, dark circles, wrinkles and fine lines, giving you a brighter, more youthful appearance around the eyes. The Contour Décolleté is always recommended for the treatment of the neck, reducing signs of aging while helping to create a smoother texture and lifted appearance. The face, neck and décolleté are one visual cosmetic complexion unit, so it’s important to treat the whole area as one so that everything is in sync.

How to Get Better Skin While You Sleep was last modified:  February 21st, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer",How to Get Better Skin While You Sleep,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/polishes_900x450.jpg
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/retinol-and-vitamin-c-how-to-layer/,"How Should You Layer Retinol and Vitamin C Into The Daily Skincare Routine?
In Lancer Skincare, patients start with The Method, using Polish, Cleanse and Nourish to treat and renew the skin. Once The Method becomes part of their everyday routine, Advanced C Radiance Treatment and Advanced Retinol Treatment can be added in slowly, but it’s important to alternate between the two instead of using them together.
Vitamin C is known to reduce the appearance of UV damage and dark spots while brightening skin tone and assisting with skin cell regeneration. Retinol softens wrinkles and fine lines while improving the appearance of skin elasticity, texture and tone. Both build collagen, fade dark spots, soften wrinkles and give you a more youthful complexion. However, to see benefits, it’s important that you use them separately for a couple of reasons. First reason being that they operate at different PH levels. When mixed, the Retinol’s PH will drop while the Vitamin C’s PH will escalate to higher than it needs to be. This change in PH will actually make them less effective, which defeats the purpose of using them.
The two products also have different solubility requirements as retinol is oil-soluble and Vitamin C is water soluble. The two fail to dissolve when mixed together and therefore, its ingredient won’t penetrate the skin the way we’d like it to. If it can’t go deep into the skin, we can’t receive its benefits.
Using Retinol and Vitamin C Safely
If you’re interested in using both products, you could use Vitamin C in the morning and Retinol at night. Another option would be alternating between products every other day. You could use Polish and Cleanse in the morning and Cleanse, Advanced C Radiance Treatment and Nourish at night. You could follow this routine on a Monday, Wednesday and Friday then change it up the other nights. Tuesday and Thursday could be your Retinol nights and you can see how the skin responds following that schedule. One thing to note is that Retinol should only be used at night as the treatment makes skin more sensitive to UV rays. You could be damaging your skin if you use it during the day, so always keep retinol treatments for bedtime.

Retinol and Vitamin C – How To Layer was last modified:  February 20th, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer",Retinol and Vitamin C – How To Layer,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Retinol_Vitamin_C_900x450.jpg
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/why-you-should-include-retinol-in-your-skincare-routine/,"Retinol – a must have product in your skincare routine. This powerful, anti-aging treatment boosts collagen production and cell turnover, reduces the appearance of hyperpigmentation, softens fine lines and wrinkles, treats acne and improves skin texture. It’s your personal magic wand to treat a variety of skin concerns and works for all skin types.
A Little About Retinol
Retinol is a form of Retinoic Acid, which is a form of Vitamin C that goes through various forms of conversion in the skin. Retinol is the more common product used in skincare and it’s significantly more gentle than Retinoic Acid. However, it does take longer to show benefits. But when it does, it really works to improve your skin’s appearance.
If you’re looking for a high-quality Retinol, Dr. Lancer’s Advanced Retinol Treatment is a supercharged nighttime serum that contains 1.25% Retinol with Bakuchiol, a plant-derived retinol-mimicking compound to deliver younger-looking skin. Co-Retinol Technology, a powerful blend of Retinol, Bakuchiol and a Soy Complex, is the key to softening those fine lines and wrinkles, while improving the appearance of skin elasticity, texture and tone. Collagen and Prickly Pear Extract are also key ingredients as they minimize the look of redness and dryness while keeping the skin hydrated. If your goal is to have youthful skin, Advanced Retinol Treatment is sure to make a difference.

What Age Should You Start To Use Retinol?
An ideal time to start using Retinol would be when a patient is in their 20’s, but you can actually use it at any age since it has so many benefits. No matter your age, gender or skin type, Retinol is always started slowly and requires patience on your end. The product is to be used only at night and after polishing and cleansing. Retinol makes skin more sensitive to sunlight, so applying it at night is important.
How Often Should This Be Used In My Skincare Routine?
In terms of weekly applications, most patients start using Retinol once a week in the evening and then slowly increase use to twice weekly. You could start on a Monday night, then do Monday and Thursday night the next week and see how your skin responds. As skin gets used to the product, you can increase application to 3-4 times a week if your skin isn’t experiencing any signs of irritation. As for the amount, a small amount can go a long way. You can use up to 2 pumps on the face, neck and decollate, applying it with upward strokes.
With Advanced Retinol Treatment in your routine, your skin should not only appear more balanced and youthful, but healthier which is what we strive for.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/sunscreen-guide/,"When we’re at the beach, most of us apply sunscreen from head to toe. We were taught early on to protect our skin from the summer sun, but what most of us learn later, is that sunscreen needs to be applied every day. Yes, all 365 days – rain or shine, indoors or outdoors. You might think you’re safe if you’re indoors, but remember those windows. UVA light comes through our windows and contributes to skin cancer risk and photoaging.
When you apply sunscreen, you’re taking action in helping your skin stay healthy and youthful. Sunscreen prevents premature ageing, painful sunburns and worst of all – skin cancer. While it’s important to use sunblock every day, it’s crucial that you reapply it throughout the day. We sweat, we touch our face, it comes off. We need to reapply it for it to work and it’s recommended that you reapply it every two hours no matter your location.
How Much Sunscreen Should You Be Applying To Protect Your Skin?

The amount of sunscreen applied also makes a difference. It’s been said that you should use two ounces or a shot glass of sunscreen, but exact measurements are not always the answer. Dr. Lancer recommends that you use a thin layer of sunscreen to cover the whole body, and use as much as it takes to get every exposed area protected.
What SPF Number Is Best To Use?
The SPF number should be 15 at the bare minimum. There are benefits to using SPF 30 and above, but if you use SPF 15 every couple of hours, you should be in good shape. Make sure you’re applying sunblock to your entire face and any exposed areas. Around your eyes, by your ears, lips, the sides of the neck, back of the neck, etc. Get all areas that you would normally forget about. The Sunscreen you select should also have broad spectrum in the title. Broad Spectrum protects against both UVA and UVB rays, so make sure you see broad spectrum to get full protection.
If you’re looking for a quality sunscreen, Dr. Lancer’s Sheer Fluid Sun Shield Broad Spectrum SPF30 sunscreen will protect your skin against harmful UV rays while providing ant-aging benefits. Not only will you be protecting your skin, but you’ll be using a product that helps skin restore its youth. Its ingredients include Gamay Grape Stem Cells to help reduce the appearance of UV damage and Sunflower Sprout Extracts to improve skin radiance and glow. It also has Chamomile Extract to soothe and calm the skin. The sunscreen is a weightless fluid that has many benefits and is non-greasy.
To apply it, use a good amount on the face, neck and décolleté after using The Method and any advanced treatments. Massage it in from the center out until it’s absorbed. It’s recommended that you apply it before and during sun exposure and remember, reapply it every two hours to keep skin protected.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/improve-your-skin-with-vitamin-c/,"How Does Vitamin C Work In Improving Skin’s Overall Complexion?
Vitamin C is important for the function of every organ in the body. It’s needed to grow and repair bodily tissue and is somewhat of a scavenger for bad or harmful molecules. Vitamin C neutralizes free radicals, minimizing and protecting cells against its effects. It may also prevent illnesses and diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Vitamin C is also known to boost the immune system, heals wounds quickly, protects skin cells from UV exposure, and helps the body produce collagen. Collagen is a protein in the body that depletes over time and causes skin to age, so it’s important to keep collagen production going to maintain a youthful complexion.
Where to Get Your Dose of Vitamin C
Something to remember about Vitamin C is that it isn’t produced by the body, but can be found in a healthy diet. Many fruits and veggies like oranges, papaya, lemon, cauliflower and broccoli have Vitamin C, so if you already eat a lot of these foods then you’re getting your dose of goodness.
If you’re specifically looking for a product that will focus on the skin and give it the boost it needs, Dr. Lancer’s Advanced C Radiance Treatment will work to transform your skin to a healthier, more radiant complexion. The treatment contains 10% Vitamin C and Retinol and is used to brighten the skin while lessening the appearance of UV damage and other signs of aging. Vitamin C impedes melanin production, helping to fade dark spots and balance out skin tone. Advanced C Radiance treatment also assists with cell regeneration, reduces fine lines and wrinkles, firms the skin, thickens the dermis and provides soothing moisture for all skin types, genders and ethnicities. Skin should appear smoother, even toned and more youthful with consistent use.

To use, apply the product in the morning and gently massage it into the skin. It can be used once or twice daily to the face, neck and décolleté area, followed by The Method: Nourish and sunscreen.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/instant-contour-firming-treatment-the-new-facelift-in-a-jar/,"Imagine a complexion that is lifted, tightened, firmed and contoured without surgery, ultrasound machines and downtime. A “facelift in a jar” that can be used at home. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, that product is finally here and is for all skin types!
Lancer Skincare is launching a brand-new advanced treatment called Instant Contour Firming Treatment, which was inspired by in-office procedures performed by Dr. Lancer. At the Beverly Hills clinic, Dr. Lancer uses specific ultrasound machines to tighten and lift loose, sagging skin, ultimately giving a facelift using energy. While ultrasound machines are highly effective, Dr. Lancer also wanted to create a topical product that could be used at home to get similar results for those who are unable to visit the office. The product is easy to use, produces immediate and long-term anti-aging benefits, and works quickly to produce a firmer, lifted, more taut appearance.
So what are the secret ingredients to make this product so effective and unique? It is formulated with six incredible ingredients that produce immediate results, and long-term benefits. Together, they are the perfect cookbook to a youthful transformation.
Cone Snail Venom Bio Peptide, Honey Locust Seed and Hyaluronic Acid are ingredients that help produce immediate results. Cone Snail Venon Bio Peptide instantly relaxes lines and wrinkles while Honey Locust Seed tightens and smooth wrinkles in no time. Hyaluronic Acid plumps and hydrates the skin, making it feel fresh, balanced and comfortable.
For ingredients that produce long-term benefits, Squalane, Kangaroo Paw Flower and Inca Nut Peptide are added. Squalane hydrates and boosts the moisture barrier, Kangaroo Paw Flower lifts and firms skin long-term while boosting collagen and elastin production, and Inca Nut Peptide sculps and smooths the skin, reducing the appearance of the sagging.
When using this product, it’s recommended that you apply a small amount to the face in the morning and at night, after using The Method: Cleanse. Focus on areas of the face that would benefit, such as the eye area, jowls, and nasolabial folds. Finish your skincare routine with The Method: Nourish, and in the morning, follow with sunscreen.
Instant Contour Firming Treatment is also the perfect complement for our Contour Décolleté Firming Concentrate. Both products work to give you younger, firmer skin and contain Cone Snail Venom Bio-Peptide, the ingredient that reduces the appearance of lines and wrinkles. Instant Contour Firming Treatment can be used on the face while Contour Décolleté Firming Concentrate is recommended for the neck, décolleté and bustline.

We’ve reached a new sense of normalcy. Vaccines are widely available to the public and we’re doing our part to stop Covid from spreading by getting vaccinated, social distancing, and continuing to wear our masks. The world has finally opened up again as many of us are more comfortable stepping out in public and getting back to the activities we once enjoyed. There’s a new sense of excitement in the air as people are out and about, finally enjoying life and their surroundings again.
As people come out of hibernation, many focus on restoring their health and beauty. This new desire to get in shape again comes from many things, but mostly it’s from the lack of self-care experienced while in quarantine and a need to take charge. Men and women of all ages and skin types have newfound motivation to look their best – and from head to toe.
Every day, I see at least 5-10 new patients requesting to be put on a Lancer Skincare regimen or I’ll see patients who would like to refresh their existing Lancer Skincare program. The top concern I see most is usually color correction and unification. That means from head to toe nude, patients want their complexion to be as blended and as even as possible. They simply want to be uniform, youthful, and fresh. I start them on The Method: Polish, Cleanse & Nourish to begin a healthy skin transformation, and then recommend advanced treatments to help them achieve an even skin tone. I may recommend Advanced Retinol Treatment, Advanced C Radiance Treatment or a mask such as Caviar Lime Acid Peel, Radiance Awakening Mask or Clarifying Detox Mask. It all depends on what the skin needs to achieve color restoration and fresh, radiant skin.
Procedures in small doses have also started to rise again in popularity. Whether it’s energy-based devices for firming and lifting, lasers, radio frequency, fractionated treatments of ultrasound, volume replacement or thread lifting, there has been more of a demand for these procedures in small doses in the last few months as things get back to normal. These procedures have all been for various parts of the body including the face, chest, cleavage line, arms and legs.
Before undergoing procedures, Lancer products are used first to transform the skin to a more youthful, fresh and healthy complexion. Once there’s a skincare routine in place, selective procedures can begin after 2-6 weeks. The time to take care of your skin and health is now, so welcome back to the world of beauty and self-care.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/covid-19-vaccines-will-you-experience-swelling-if-you-have-facial-fillers/,"Covid-19 Vaccines – Will You Experience Swelling if You Have Facial Fillers? 
There’s been a lot of gossip out there in recent months. Many are curious if they’ll experience facial swelling if they’ve had dermal fillers and get a COVID-19 Vaccine. So, is all of this true or just gossip? First, let’s rewind a bit.
An urgent push for a vaccination was made approx. a year and a half ago. The vaccines thus far created and in development are called RNA generated vaccines. They’re more simple than the usual vaccines that require much lengthier development time as they’re far more broad reaching and of a protein production nature. None the less, the two main vaccines (Pfizer & Moderna) were released in the US in December, with a third (Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine) released shortly after.
In January 2021, there were some reports of facial swelling or globalized swelling in areas where volume replacement injections for cosmetic reasons have been placed. However, it’s important to note that more than 68 million doses have bee administered and there’s only been a handful of reports of skin body reactions consisting mainly of swelling.
My personal opinion is that this is a tempest in a teapot, meaning an issue or event that has been exaggerated out of proportion. The issue has become bigger than it needs to be for a variety of publicity reasons and is not a significant dermatologic cosmetic threat. I have seen at least a dozen reports from “experts” and my personal opinion is that this is a minor event, easily treated should it occur with anti-inflammatory oral medication and resolves nightly without the need to remove any volumized injectable agent. The publicity on this has been excessive and surprising because the truth is that when volumizing agents are first introduced to the body, it’s considered a foreign material and it’s not uncommon for a vaccine that creates an increased immune response to inflame the area injected or treated.
Swelling or other reactions have been known to happen with other vaccinations and with other people that have had concurrent illnesses as well as having volumizing injections done. Patients have also experienced this same reaction during dental procedures and dental cleanings. So, in summary, when you have a material introduced into the body, anything can trigger a brief inflammatory response and I can work with you to manage it appropriately.
I can also say that I’ve personally had fillers and the vaccine, and had no swelling or any kind of reaction at all, so there is no true tie to the Vaccine, fillers and facial swelling. So, take a deep breath and relax. Get the Vaccine, proceed with your plans to get fillers if you would like them and don’t be driven by fear.

We all know that skincare, diet, exercise and the amount of sleep we get each night affects our skin and overall appearance. However, most of us tend to forget that the environment and climate change also influence the behavior of our skin and complexion from head to toe.
Climate change together with other natural environmental and man-made health stressors can influence general human health and can cause the skin to age quicker. We all know about what excessive sun exposure without sunscreen does to the skin. Sunburns are the least of our worries, as premature aging, wrinkles, uneven skin tone and skin cancer have all become the top issues that result from too much ultraviolet radiation and not enough skin protection.
However, excessive ultraviolet radiation is just one factor that causes negative changes in our skin. Visible light, infrared light, heat factors, pollution levels and the environment’s current state all impact the skin. Looking at this year, there have been wild fires and destruction of the normal atmospheric mix. Hurricanes, floods and a variety of changes in swings of humidity and dryness have occurred over the months. All of these environmental shifts influence complexion.
Diving into heat factors, atmospheric heat and heat caused by habit meaning saunas/jacuzzis should all be taken into consideration when thinking about heats affect on the skin. Both types of heat affect complexion, overall color, texture, pore size, plumpness, vibrance and skin bounce. If you love saunas, the length of exposure to infrared saunas is important to keep in mind for skin health. A 5-15 minute session occasionally is fine and has great benefits. Your body can acclimate and restore itself quickly, as complexion can acclimate. However, a daily 30-65 minutes infrared sauna experience may cause some harm, causing cronically dilated blood vessels, cronically dilated pores, and can cause excess pigment formation.
In regards to pollution, smog particles settle onto the skin, increasing inflammation and triggering skin pigmentation and acne. It can also cause dehydration and premature aging as it’s known to break down collagen and elastin, causing skin to sag. To protect the skin from permanent damage and help it repair itself, I recommend that you use:

The Method: Polish & Cleanse nightly to remove all those environmental toxins accumulated during the day.
Active Rejuvenation Serum with triple dermal complex is also recommended to revitalize skin as it provides anti-aging benefits. The serum helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles as it makes skin feel and look softer and more youthful.
Lastly, Sheer Fluid Sun Shield (A weightless, non-greasy Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen) protects skin from harmful UV rays while providing key anti-aging ingredients that helps skin look younger.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/stress-how-it-impacts-the-skin-medical-version/,"Stress & How it Impacts the Skin – Medical Version 
How often do you say you’re stressed? Twice a week? Every day? If it’s every day, you may need to stop and think about what that really means for your body. Sure, you feel overwhelmed in the moment. There’s just not enough time in the day to do everything on your list, but stress can lead to more serious consequences if it lasts for too long.
When we’re stressed, our body’s nervous system orders the release of three major stress hormones: Cortisol, Adrenaline and Noradrenaline. These stress horomones are the same hormones that trigger the body’s flight or fight response, helping you cope with the “danger” you’re supposed to be experiencing. Stress comes in various forms – mental, physical and emotional. Therefore, stress can have a different definition for each person. Either way, If stress is recurring, it can cause the following issues:
Heachaches, heartburn, rapid breathing, risk of heart attack, fertility problems, low sex drive, stomach issues, high blood pressure, a weakened immune system, depression, insomnia and changes in the skin.
When it comes to skin and stress, Cortisol and Testosterone are the two stress hormones that cause the skin to react. Stress can cause your skin to turn stone cold because of vascular tightening. Your fingers, toes and skin may feel icy as the hair on your arms stand up. Looking closely at your skin, you may see enlarged pores and your face might look flushed. Stress also causes an increase in oil production, perspiration and the repair mechanism of the skin is likely to alter. Skin does not repair at the same rate as it does when you’re relaxed. In addition, stress influences blood flow and oxygen flow to the skin, and alters the cooling and heating functions of the body.
To help control stress and its effects, I recommend eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, exercise, deep breathing, meditation or whatever calms your soul, and committing to following a skincare routine that benefits your skin.
Your skin is constantly changing because of hormonal shifting, so what you may need for your skin can differ from second to second. Sometimes you’ll use The Method: Cleanse Sensitive-Dehydrated twice daily with The Method: Polish Normal-Combination, or you might stick to using The Method Normal-Combination kit. Whatever your skin calls for, there are 3 types for The Method: Normal Combination Skin, Sensitive Dehydrated Skin and the Oily Congested skin.
In terms of what you would use, it all depends on environmental, personal, psychiatric stress at the moment as well as skin type.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/alcohol-and-smoking-how-it-changes-your-skin/,"Alcohol and Smoking – How it Changes Your Skin 
Lancer Skincare, quality sleep, exercise, diet and nutrition are vital for achieving healthy, radiant skin. However, if you’re drinking more alcohol and smoking because of our new circumstances, you might not be seeing the results you want. Covid and our own life issues have caused us to drink more, whether it’s beer, shots, a cocktail or champagne. You might be drinking more with friends, or even alone at home – no judgement!
If you’re drinking more, you’re most likely smoking more if that’s a habit of yours, so here’s the story – smoking and drinking can dramatically change your skin. Alcohol is an oxidizing agent that dehydrates the skin, stops normal skin repair mechanisms, reduces collagen production and skin plumpness and increases the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s one of the key factors that cause premature aging, so it’s important to keep that in mind when you’re thinking about ordering your 2nd or 3rd drink at the bar. Excessive alcohol consumption is also known to cause eye puffiness, inflammatory skin conditions such as acne and rosacea and it reduces antioxidants in the skin – particularly vitamin A which helps with skin renewal and cell turnover. A lack of this compound inhibits your body’s ability to ward off free-radical damage and protect your skin from environmental stressors.
Another habit to kick to the curb is smoking. Smoking robs the skin of oxygen and nutrients, diminishes plumpness, diminishes the thickness of the epidermis, speeds up skin aging and gives skin a dull, lifeless quality. Soft skin might change to a leather texture, as the inside of your body catches up with the outside. Crow’s feet are likely to worsen and under eye puffiness may become more noticeable. Both habits take a toll on our bodies, but what most aren’t aware of, is how it can alter our skin in the worst ways.
To revitalize your skin from excessive alcohol consumption and smoking, you’ll need to:

Drink plenty of water to flush out the alcohol and keep the skin from dehydrating.
Remove your make up before bed to prevent pores from clogging and let your skin breathe.
Use Lancer Skincare to replenish your skin with the nutrients and hydration it needs. Here are some favorite products for locking in moisture and detoxing the skin:


Clarifying Detox Mask: A green clay mask that minimizes blemishes, decongests and detoxes the skin.
Omega Hydrating Oil: an ultra-hydrating non-greasy oil that provides a bath of hydration for the skin while allowing you to topically take your vitamins ( Omega
Hydrating Oil is full of Vitamins A, B, C, D, E)
Intensive Night Treatment: An anti-aging cream that deeply hydrates and moisturizes skin, providing a smoother, plumper appearance.
3D Hyaluronic Eye Serum: Equipped with a double-sided metal applicator that cools and soothes the skin this concentrated, lightwright serum is formulated with 3D Hyaluronic Acid, SuperOx-C, and Vitamins B3 + E to directly target the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, puffiness, and dark circles for a smoother, tighter, and brighter appearance.
With a blend of diamond powder, shea butter and caffeine, the Eye Contour Lifting Cream will help hydrate the eye area, smooth crow’s feet and brighten dark circles



The products above will help tremendously, but you’ll also need to kick these bad habits to the curb for good if you want youthful skin. Your body is your temple, so start treating it as such. With the right skincare regimen, amount of sleep, nutrition, exercise and positive health choices, your skin should be on its way to feeling and looking healthier.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/complexion-changes-during-the-pandemic/,"Complexion Changes During the Pandemic 
When the pandemic first started, it felt like we were in a movie. The circumstances just didn’t seem real. People were rushing to the store to stock up on groceries. Women were fighting over toilet paper. Nobody went outside unless it was urgent.
We eventually learned how to protect ourselves by wearing masks, washing our hands and getting the vaccine, but the stress of the pandemic hasn’t gone away. It may have faded somewhat as we’ve learned to live with it, but our stress is still very apparent.
With this added level of stress and anxiety, skin and normal body function began to alter for most people. Stress influences how we look and feel and can make our appearance suffer if we’re not careful. Stress can cause acne, skin dryness and dullness, bags under your eyes, wrinkles and gray hair. Stress can also change our normal lifestyle. Maybe we’re too stressed and overworked to eat a proper meal. Maybe we’re eating too much. Whatever it is, stress is altering our eating habits, which ultimately effects our appearance.
Take a look at your skin now. Your skin color, texture, pore size, elasticity, inflammation, oil production, dryness, and firmness might be changing because of what’s happening in the world today. Those worry lines on your forehead might be deeper, the texture of your skin might feel rough after excessive smoking for months out of stress, and your skin might be dry from neglect.
Even without the pandemic, there is always something causing us to stress out. Think about your last vacation. You might have been excited the days leading up to it, but also a bit stressed about getting everything together before you go. Then you’re on vacation, but your mind lingers to the work that awaits you when you’re back. So, you’re never really on vacation – you’re never really able to relax and enjoy the present.
To keep your stress level and skin in check, you need to evaluate how you feel on a daily basis. Because how you feel on the inside, influences how you look on the outside. When I speak to patients about this, I recommend taking 3 deep breaths every hour or so and deciding what needs to be taken care of now vs. what can wait. It’s important to keep organized and stay aware of your well being, especially during this time.
For skincare, The Method 3 Step System is the key to maintaining beautiful, healthy skin. If you don’t have a lot of time in the morning and can’t get in additional products, The Method is all you need to start that transformation and rejuvenate your skin. This powerful system exfoliates, cleanses and provides the hydration your skin needs to stay fresh and balanced.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/skin-health-looking-closely-at-diet/,"Skin Health – Looking Closely at Diet 
Raise your hand if you’re a foodie. You love dining out and trying new dishes. You may find yourself indulging even more as you work from home, or try to stay home as much as possible. Sure, many of us have already been vaccinated, but there’s still a good majority of people who haven’t so you might be taking baby steps to get back out in the world.
While food is something that makes us happy, it can have a negative effect overall if you’re not keeping active and watching what you’re eating. Overeating not only effects your appearance, it also changes your mood and confidence. After indulging in sweets or fried food, you may find yourself looking into miracle supplements online or tips to lose weight quickly. Sometimes these tips work, but not long-term. You’ll need to exercise reguarly and have a healthy diet in order to make permanent changes.
What most people don’t realize is that there’s a significant relationship between diet and lifestyle in terms of healthy skin from head to toe. Dry, itchy skin, oiliness, or enlarged pores are largely impacted by diet, lifestyle habits and skincare. Looking into diet in particular, dairy products, soy, wheat, sugar and greasy foods are all triggers for skin breakouts. These blemishes can be anywhere. Your face, shoulder, chest, stomach or back. While acne can be genetic, it also results from the food we are putting in our body 100%.
For healthy skin, I recommend commiting to a diet high in protein. That includes eating foods like beans, nuts, fish, lean meats, organic chicken or turkey, and egg whites. Fish is not only good for preventing acne, but also preserves collagen in your skin, keeping it youthful. Your diet should also include plenty of veggies – the greener the food, the better it is for your skin and body.
Let’s talk about liquids. Caffeinated products of any sort can trigger skin inflammation. Think hard before consuming coffee, soda or anything with caffeine components, as it might make your skin act out. Alcohol is also highly destructive to your complexion, as it dehydrates your skin and speeds up skin aging. Yes, more wrinkles, fine lines and dryness before it’s time if you keep up your drinking habits. It can also cause permanent facial redness – not the cute red flush we get temporarly from a few drinks one night.
To get your skin back to feeling and looking healthy, replace all sugary drinks with plenty of water. Water flushes out toxins and helps keep the skin clear, hydrated and youthful. It’s the secret to stopping premature aging. In addition to water, green juice and green tea are also recommended for healthy, glowing skin.
For skincare, the below products are recommended if you want to help revitalize or rejuvenate skin from poor dieting and bad drinking habits.

Soothe & Hydrate Serum contains hyaluronic acid, honey, aloe extracts and camellia. The serum is used to hydrate the skin, while keeping it balanced, calm and free of redness. Perfect for the dry skin we get after too much alcohol consumption.
Omega Hydrating Oil is another product that delivers instant moisture and comfort to dehydrated skin. Skin will look and feel softer instantly as the oil improves the appearance of skin elasticity, suppleness and your overall texture. Your skin will feel hydrated all day – it’s that powerful.
The Clarifying Detox Mask is my #1 mask for oily, acne-prone, congested skin. The green clay mask with 3% sulfur and azelaic acid is great for detoxing the skin, cleaning out pores and breakouts, while reducing the appearance of redness.

These three products will help promote a healthier state for skin, but ultimately you need to change your eating and drinking habits for good to have the skin you desire.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/overall-gestalt-of-appeal/,"Overall Gestalt of Appeal 
The word “Gestalt” means many things in the world of psychology and reality. In the world of beauty, Gesalt is the perceived global view of a subject or person.
When a person looks at themselves in the mirror, they have a certain perception of themselves. The perception is both conscious and subconscious, believe it or not. As a person studies themselves, there’s something that triggers that their appearance is off. Is it their arms? Foreheard? The dark circles under their eyes? After the problem area is noticed, it becomes an obsession. It’s the first thing they notice when they look in the mirror or at a photograph. Flash forward and they’re at a holiday party alone in a corner, downloading apps on their phone to fix that specific feature before sending the photo to family. We’ve all done it. Admit it!
When a patient comes into the office, I say, “show me what concerns you and how I may help.” The patient states their concern and I pass over a mirror, so they can point it out to me. After listening to the issue, I take back the mirror and take a moment to clarify the patient’s gestalt or perception of self. While a patient may be focused on a certain problem, there might be a bigger issue that’s gone unnoticed. That small skin concern that they’ve been focusing on is not the real problem afterall.
During the consultation, I take time to educate a patient on skin tone, texture, radiance, uniformity, shape, bounce and the real skin issue that should be addressed. It’s important to see things as a whole, rather than seeing things in bits and pieces. I refine a patient’s gestalt, tweaking their original perception of self as I talk through what can be done to improve their overall appearance and how to maintain the look they want in the future.
To improve the skin’s current condition, a patient will need to commit to using the right skincare products on a daily basis. The Method 3 step system (Polish, Cleanse & Nourish) with our advanced treatments reduce oiliness, pore size, redness, even skin tone and help the skin look and feel younger. It’s the fountain of youth, but bottled up and used in the comfort of your home. Depending on the individual, a certain procedure may be next in achieving the skin you want, but that’s something that can be discussed. With the right program and commitment to following the daily steps, you’ll be able to transform your skin, fixing that initial problem along the way.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/complexion-transforming-the-skin/,"Complexion & Transforming the Skin 
Complexion is a person’s greatest aspect of beauty and health. You could have clear, radiant skin reflecting excellent health, or you might have some skin imperfections due to poor lifestyle habits, diet or genetics. Your skin’s current state could be a wake-up call – it’s time to take better care of yourself – and that’s now not later.
When studying your complexion, you may focus on your facial skin. However, complexion in the world of lancer skincare focuses on skin from head to toe. You need to examine your full body, taking in skin tone and texture as a whole.
I’ve always said that skin tone is the greatest visual aspect of complexion. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of people – male, female, all age groups and ancestries – look at skin tone as a prize and value uniformity of that color from head to toe. With that said, most of us don’t have even skin tone from head to toe. Your arms and face might be darker than your neck and stomach, causing a bit of a mismatch in your skin’s appearance. Some of us just ignore it, but the majority of us want uniformity in skin tone for the whole body.
With your current appearance, you might be regretting all those times you didn’t wear sunblock. Think back. Your parents told you to apply sunscreen when you were younger, but you didn’t listen. Not only is your skin tone uneven, but you also have skin discoloration or sun spots on your face. Exposure to environmental toxins and lifestyle habits as mentioned, also play a huge part in your skin’s current appearance.
When you reach the age of recognizing coloration flaws, it’s important to take steps to repair them before moving on to other measures to improve deficiency in appearances. Color clarification is an art that requires significant cooperation with the physician rendering your care. When I evaluate various patient concerns, I see color imperfection as a primary target and select the proper Lancer Skincare protocol for at least the initial remedy before moving on to procedures. Skin health with a topical skincare routine is the first avenue of approach. Lancer Skincare is followed by in-office procedures with the knowledge that life-long maintenance of the finish product will always be needed.
To protect yourself from further skin aging and kick start the transformation process to healthier, even toned skin, I recommend using the products below in your daily skincare routine:
MORNING ROUTINE

Start with The Method 3 step system to exfoliate, cleanse and hydrate the skin.
After The Method, use Advanced C Radiance Treatment with 10% Vitamin C & Retinol. The treatment was touched upon in our intro and is an essential anti-aging product that brightens and evens skin tone while reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Finish up your skincare routine with sunblock! The Sheer Fluid Sun Shield SPF 30 protects the skin from UV damage while providing the skin with key anti-aging ingredients to keep skin feeling and looking young.

With a routine down for transforming your complexion, you might be in need of an eye treatment as well. Don’t forget about the delicate skin around your eyes!

3D Hyaluronic Eye Serum features a cooling metal applicator and contains Vitamin B3 + E, Vitamin C and of course Hyaluronic Acid. The serum helps reduce dark circles, puffiness and crow’s feet around the eyes.

NIGHT ROUTINE

Start your routine with The Method Polish (if not used in the morning) & Cleanse.
I also recommend using a quality mask if you want to keep your skin healthy and improve skin tone. Two favorites at the clinic are the Caviar Lime Acid Peel and Radiance Awakening Mask. The Caviar Lime Acid Peel treats dull, stressed skin as it removes dead surface cells, revealing a brighter, smoother and even toned complexion. The Radiance Awakening Mask is also a complexion brightening treatment that quickly absorbs into the skin, reducing discoloration and dull-looking skin. Leave the mask on overnight and wake up to radiant, glowing skin. Both masks should be used once or twice a week, altering between days.
If you’re not using the Radiance Awakening Mask at night, you can use Advanced Retinol Treatment. Advanced Retinol was also touched upon in our intro and includes 1.25% Retinol and Bakuchiol, which improves the appearance of skin elasticity, texture, tone and softens fine lines and wrinkles.
Younger Pure Youth Serum with MIMIXYL™ is also highly recommended, especially for those with more sensitive skin, as it contains a propriety blend of plant-based retinoids, Glycolic Acid and Bakuchiol to provide the same powerful effects of retinol without irritating and overly stimulating the skin.
For PM eye treatments, the Eye Countour Lifting Cream with Diamond Powder is great for brightening, hydrating and firming the eye area. It also reduces the appearance of puffiness, dark circles, fine lines and wrinkles.

With a day and night routine in place, you’ll start to see a brighter, even toned complexion. Remember to keep up the routine and to use the products in a system to have long-lasting results.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/fact-or-fiction-cucumbers-eliminate-bags-under-your-eyes/,"We love putting sliced cucumbers under our eyes to reduce eye puffiness. However, the cucumber itself may not be what’s making a difference in reducing the swelling. Anything you place under the eyes that’s cold will most likely reduce puffiness and eye bags. You could use cucumbers, sliced tomatoes or even a cold wash cloth.
Dr. Lancer’s eye products can also help eliminate any puffiness, in addition to addressing other eye area concerns, such as dark circles and fine lines, too. Here are some products that we recommend more highly than a slice of cucumber:

Lancer Legacy Eye Treatment Duo Day & Night– The eye treatment duo is crafted with the highest quality ingredients and is applied with a unique triple rollerball applicator that gently massages the eye area. The day treatment de-puffs and brightens the eye area with ingredients such as Crushed Pearl and Caffeine Pep Compound. The Night treatment hydrates, renews and firms the eye area with Black Pearl, Peony Youth Compound and White Truffle Extract.
3D Hyaluronic Eye Serum– A concentrated, lightweight serum with Vitamin C Brightening Complex. The serum contains a cool tip applicator and is known to reduce the appearance of puffiness, dark circles, fine lines and wrinkles. The eye area will appear smoother, tighter and brighter with consistent use and skin will feel well hydrated and soft.
Eye Contour Lifting Cream– A triple-action eye treatment with a balanced mix of Diamond Powder, Alfalfa Seed Extract, Lupine Protein, Hyaluronic Acid, Shea Butter, Peptide Blend & Yeast Extract. The powerful cream reduces puffiness, dark circles, fine lines and wrinkles while providing rich hydration around the eyes. This eye cream is known for its hydrating abilities, so it’s sure to keep skin feeling moisturized all day. The eye zone should also appear brighter and more youthful as the product also improves the look of skin’s firmness and elasticity.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/myth-can-stress-cause-acne/,"Acne is caused by many factors. Stress is in fact one of them. Stress influences the body and skin, causing it to react in negative ways. You could develop acne, eczema, hives, rosacea, psoriasis, alopecia, vitiligo and more. if you already have acne, stress can make it worse and delay healing time, so it’s important to try and manage your stress levels to keep your body and skin healthy. To help reduce stress, you can do a number of activities that are proven to help. Yoga, meditation, regular exercise, a healthy diet, a good night’s rest, deep breathing exercises and simply knowing that whatever you’re stressed about is not that important in the long-run, can help manage your stress levels.
For skincare, it’s important to use the right products to work with blemished skin and prevent future breakouts. Dr Lancer recommends the products below to keep skin healthy:

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/myth-is-acne-genetic/,"Yes, it’s true: acne is, in fact, genetic. Blemishes are triggered by multiple genes rather than one, so you can’t really blame one side of your family for your skin’s poor condition. While it’s helpful to know that acne has a genetic origin, it’s also important to remember that there are other factors causing breakouts. Stress, hormones, the environment, lack of sleep, poor nutrition and alcohol play a significant role in how skin looks, so committing to a healthier, more balanced lifestyle can go a long way in helping to keep blemishes in check.
As you make positive changes to your lifestyle, it’s also important to have the right skincare routine. Dr. Lancer offers the following products for skin that tends to be oily, congested, and blemished:

The Method: Oily-Congested Set – A 3-step daily skincare routine for congested and oily skin:

Step #1, Polish, includes Quartz Crystals, Pumpkin Enzyme, and Pomegranate Enzyme to exfoliate the skin, and Salicylic Acid, an ingredient known to reduce skin congestion.

Step #3, Nourish, is a lightweight moisturizer that provides essential hydration without clogging pores.


Clarifying Detox Mask with Green Tea + 3% Sulfur – A green clay mask for oily, acne-prone skin. The mask contains 3% Sulfur, a powerful ingredient that clears up blemishes as it decongests your skin.

The temperature is just right and overall, it feels good. But does hot water clean the skin better? It’s an interesting question – but the answer is no. Many are unaware of this, but hot water can actually damage the skin, causing excess blood vessels to form and even increasing pore size. So overall, hot water might do the opposite of what some are expecting.
It’s recommended that you use lukewarm water and one of Dr. Lancer’s cleansers to clean the skin efficiently. Here are the cleansers we recommend to keep skin looking its best:

The Method: Cleanse Normal-Combination Skin – Our normal combination cleanser gently removes skin impurities with Rice Silk Proteins, Amino Acids, and Aloe Extract. Salicylic Acid specifically removes those dry surface cells, giving you a healthier complexion if used consistently.
The Method: Cleanse Sensitive-Dehydrated Skin – If your skin needs some extra hydration, this is the cleanser for you. Our cleanser contains Amino Acids and Lavender Oil, two important ingredients for cleaning the skin and keeping it balanced and hydrated. Cleanse Sensitive-Dehydrated Skin also has Oat Extract, Coconut Oil and Licorice Phytocompounds, all powerful ingredients for reducing any skin irritation or redness.
The Method: Cleanse Oily-Congested Skin – A cleanser for oily prone skin. The cleanser contains jojoba beads, Salicylic Acid, Tea Tree Oil and Lilac Stem Cell Compound, ingredients key to washing away skin impurities while managing excess oil and unclogging pores simultaneously. Tea Tree Oil specifically helps combat oiliness and soothe skin.

It’s a new trend amongst some to contour their faces by placing sunscreen only on certain areas of the skin, leaving a portion of the face unprotected and able to tan – or burn, as you might say! While it’s definitely an interesting idea, Dr. Lancer recommends that we put this fad to rest and use sunscreen the way it’s intended to be used. Sunscreen protects us from those harmful UV rays, reduces environmental toxins and is known to be our skin’s best protection. It’s important to know that this method of contouring isn’t helping your skin in any way. Instead, it’s speeding up skin aging and taking a risk of potentially getting skin cancer, if out in the sun often.
To keep skin protected and in the best condition possible, Dr. Lancer recommends using Sheer Fluid Sun Shield, a Broad Spectrum SPF30 sunscreen. It should be used on the entire face to fully protect the skin from sun damage and prevent hyperpigmentation. Sun Shield also delivers anti-aging ingredients to help the skin look and feel more youthful and is unique as it’s a non-greasy, lightweight product that gently glides onto the skin.
To use, simply apply the sunscreen after The Method. Gently massage it into the skin, starting from the center out. Apply it before your outing and make sure to reapply every 2 hours, to fully protect your skin.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/do-it-yourself-coffee-facial-scrub-do-or-dont/,"Many people have gotten creative with their exfoliation, experimenting with coffee grounds and other substances with a similar texture. While the texture of coffee grounds may feel similar to a facial scrub, Dr. Lancer recommends steering clear from using it for exfoliation purposes. Depending on the size of the ground, and other factors, coffee facial scrubs could potentially cause cuts and bruising to the skin, as well as discoloration and streaks.
To keep skin looking fresh and even toned, Dr. Lancer recommends these three effective treatments to exfoliate the skin:

The Method: Polish Normal-Combination Skin – a daily exfoliator that removes dry, dull skin cells, leaving you with a fresh, radiant complexion. Polish contains Quartz Crystals, Pumpkin and Pomegranate Enzymes, all powerful ingredients that work together to brighten and even the skin’s complexion in a safe and effective manner. In particular, Quartz Crystals are known to be uniform in size and shape and will exfoliate without abrading the skin.
The Method: Body Polish – For those who wish to exfoliate from head to toe, here’s the product for you. The warming daily exfoliator contains Quartz Crystals, Bamboo Stem Powder and chemical exfoliants such as Salicylic Acid and Retinol. These key ingredients remove dead skin cells, allowing new skin to the surface. Shea Butter is also included to balance the exfoliants, giving the product a silky rich texture.
Pro Polish Microdermabrasion Device – A handheld microdermabrasion device to use in the comfort of your own home. This device was inspired by the microdermabrasion equipment at Lancer Dermatology and was designed to exfoliate the face and body with three different suction settings. By exfoliating the surface of the skin, this product helps speed up cell turnover, giving you a renewed, rejuvenated complexion.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/myth-facial-slugging-a-trend-do-or-dont/,"Has your skin been super dry lately? A recent trend shows that consumers apply Vaseline or a type of grease on their face at night and keep it on as they sleep to retain skin moisture. Dr. Lancer suggests staying away from this habit as it’s not only messy (you’re sure to roll around at night and get it on your pillows and sheets), but Vaseline also retains heat. Retaining heat congests pores, giving you blemishes and irritating the skin.
To keep skin moisturized and balanced, Dr. Lancer recommends using these Lancer favorites:

The Method: Nourish Normal-Combination Skin – This daily moisturizer is used to hydrate the skin while providing anti-aging benefits. Nourish contains Peptides and Hyaluronic Acid to firm, lift and smooth fine lines and wrinkles, while Avocado and Olive Fruit Oils boost hydration and moisture-retention. Skin should appear well hydrated, glowing and plump after use. https://www.lancerskincare.com/nourish
Omega Hydrating Oil – The best extra boost of hydration in a bottle. This lightweight, non-greasy oil delivers essential hydration and antioxidants to the skin with its perfect blend of ingredients. It contains fermented oils including Argan, Olive, Jojoba and Grapeseed as well as Omega Fatty Acids, which improve skin elasticity and suppleness. Turmeric, another important ingredient, also reduces any skin redness while Chlorophyllin-Cooper Complex improves skin texture and pore size. https://www.lancerskincare.com/omega-hydrating-oil
Nourish Rehydration Mask – This effective, hydrating mask is a New Beauty Award 2021 Winner. The mask contains Bio-Peptide & Vitamin B3 and is used to hydrate and revive dull, dehydrated skin. The ingredients not only boost hydration, but also prevent moisture loss, keeping skin smooth with a healthy, glowing complexion. https://www.lancerskincare.com/nourish-rehydration-mask
Intensive Night Treatment – This luxurious, rich cream is an anti-aging treatment and moisturizer combined. It’s intended for evening use and contains ultra-hydrating ingredients such as Hyaluronic Acid, Marula Oil and Shea Butter. The ingredients help skin retain hydration while firming and lifting the skin with Peptides and Amino Acids. Intensive Night Treatment helps skin feel plump, smooth and lifted, with a new sense of firmness. https://www.lancerskincare.com/intensive-night-treatment

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/myth-do-or-dont-at-home-face-shaving-dermaplaning/,"Dermaplaning is a great way to refresh the skin. The procedure consists of gliding a fine surgical blade across the surface of the face to remove dead skin and peach fuzz, and reduce the appearance of acne scars. Removing the top layer of skin allows for a brighter, cleaner complexion that feels smooth, healthy and vibrant. With a fresh layer of skin revealed, skincare products can perform much more quickly and effectively.
Now, would it be a good idea to do it at home yourself? Probably not. Dr. Lancer strongly recommends going to a medical spa or a medical office and leaving this procedure in the hands of the professionals. Doing it yourself could potentially cause issues. Not only is it possible to harm your skin with the blade, but the blade or your hands may be contaminated with bacteria, which could lead to a skin infection.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/myth-skincare-products-never-expire/,"All skincare products expire at some point. However, the timing all depends on the quality of the product, its ingredients, its packaging, how it was made and where it has been stored. Keeping a product out of direct sunlight, and in a cool, room-temperature place in your home can make a huge difference in when it will expire.
Quality products like those at Lancer Skincare may last 1-3 years, while others that are store bought at a local pharmacy may last approximately 3 months. Depending on the product and packaging, some products in bottles may experience bacterial growth, and some products in metal packaging may rust quickly. It is important to stay on top of your skincare products’ expiration dates, as expired cosmetics may cause skin irritation or infections if used longer than they should be.

If you live in a city with a significant level of air pollution, it could be contributing to premature skin aging, age spots, fine lines and wrinkles! Solar Ultra Radiation, Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and cigarette smoke are some of the air pollutants that can have a significant effect on the complexion. Smog particles in particular settle onto the skin, increasing inflammation and triggering skin pigmentation, acne and allergic skin conditions like dermatitis and eczema. It can also cause dehydration in our skin and is known for breaking down collagen and elastic, causing skin to lose elasticity.
To help restore and protect the skin from environmental damage, it’s recommended to use these Lancer favorites:

The Method: Polish & Cleanse – This dynamic duo removes environmental toxins accumulated during the day. Polish is a daily exfoliator that contains Quartz Crystals and Pumpkin and Pomegranate enzymes, effectively removing surface debris and dull skin cells, leaving a renewed, healthy-looking complexion.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/myth-the-more-products-in-your-skincare-routine-the-better/,"Most of us have a variety of products we use on our skin. We use them, thinking the more we apply, the better our skin will look. Dr. Lancer says that’s not always true, as we should be specifically thinking about what skincare concerns we would like to address, and target those concerns. If it’s reducing pore size, treating acne or evening skin tone, it only matters that the right combination of skincare products are being used, not necessarily that more products are used.
At the foundation of any skincare regimen, it is important to exfoliate, cleanse, and moisturize the skin. The Lancer Method of Polish, Cleanse and Nourish is that essential regimen, and the key to healthier and more youthful looking skin. This regimen accelerates cell turnover, removes oil, dirt and debris, and delivers essential hydration, moisture and nutrients, leaving skin looking fresh and renewed. Dr. Lancer developed three versions of The Lancer Method depending on skin type: Normal-Combination, Sensitive-Dehydrated, and Oily-Congested.

The Method: Normal-Combination – A skincare regimen for skin that is neither dry nor oily. These formulas are recommended for skin that rarely experiences sensitivity, dryness or breakouts.
https://www.lancerskincare.com/the-method-normal-combo-skin-regiment-set-normal-combination-set
The Method: Sensitive-Dehydrated – A skincare regimen for sensitive skin. If you tend to experience dryness or redness easily, this set is features ingredients to help keep skin looking calm and healthy.

The Method: Oily-Congested – A skincare regimen for congested, oily skin. The set has ingredients that will help balance skin and deliver a radiant, healthy looking complexion.

After sticking to this program for about a month, reevaluate skincare concerns, and add Advanced Treatment products as needed. Whether looking to address skin texture, pore size, acne, or lines and wrinkles, Lancer Skincare has several targeted products to address various concerns. Remember, it is not about the number of products you use. It’s about using quality products and finding the right skincare regimen for your specific concerns.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/myth-you-only-need-spf-during-bright-sunny-weather/,"Sunscreen is typically associated with a relaxing day at the beach. You might be laying on a beach chair with your favorite hat, a good book and you’ve applied the goods. However, sunscreen should be used daily during sunny or overcast weather and no matter the location. Going out to your favorite coffee shop and doing some shopping? You need sunscreen then too. Dr. Lancer always tells patients that if there’s light, even from the lighting of a photo shoot, you need to protect your skin…and from head to toe.
For spring and summer tips, Dr. Lancer recommends that you apply Sheer Fluid Sun Shield Broad Spectrum SPF30 Sunscreen four times daily on all exposed skin. Very few sunscreens provide protection past 2-3 hours, so it’s important to reapply! Dr. Lancer’s sunscreen not only protects your skin from harmful UV rays, but also provides key anti-aging ingredients to keep skin looking and feeling youthful.

Sheer Fluid Sun Shield Broad Spectrum SPF30 Sunscreen – The weightless fluid sunscreen contains Gamay Grape Stem Cells, Sunflower Sprout Extracts and Chamomile Extract. Gamay Grape Stem Cells reduce the appearance of UV damage and fight the appearance of photo-aging, while Sunflower Sprout Extracts help improve skin radiance and a healthy glow. Chamomile Extract is also of importance as it helps calm and soothe the skin.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/myth-breakouts-only-occur-in-your-teens/,"When you think of acne, you might think of someone in their teen years. However, blemishes on the skin can occur at any age. Breakouts have been seen on newborns, teens and adults, and on all parts of the body – even those hidden areas we don’t think of!
Some causes of acne include hormonal changes, stress, poor diet, environmental changes, humid climates and even genetics. While acne is not dangerous, it can leave scars if not taken care of early on. To help patients keep their skin looking blemish free, Dr. Lancer developed The Method: Oily-Congested Skin. This 3-step system includes Polish, Cleanse and Nourish, which work together to keep skin looking clear and healthy by gently exfoliating the skin’s surface, effectively cleansing, and feeding the skin essential nutrients.
https://www.lancerskincare.com/the-method-oily-congested-skin-regiment-set-oily-congested-set

The Method: Polish Oily-Congested Skin is step 1 out of 3. Polish contains Quartz Crystals, Pumpkin Enzymes, Pomegranate Enzymes and Salicylic Acid, which are key ingredients to exfoliating congested skin. While all ingredients are of importance, the Pomegranate Enzymes contain powerful antioxidants to promote skin hydration while exfoliating dull surface cells.


The Method: Cleanse Oily-Congested Skin is the next step in the routine. Cleanse includes Jojoba beads, Salicylic Acid, Tea Tree Oil and Lilac Stem Cell Compound. The Jojoba beads sweep away any remaining skin impurities without stripping essential moisture, while Tea Tree Oil provides anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, helping to counteract oiliness.


The Method: Nourish Oily-Congested Skin is the last step in the system. Nourish is a lightweight moisturizer containing Hyaluronic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Tea Tree Oil and Lilac Stem Cell Compound. Hyaluronic Acid helps keep skin hydrated throughout the day while reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and Lilac Stem Cell Compound is a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.

Additionally, Dr. Lancer developed the Clarifying Detox Mask to clear up any breakouts quickly. This OTC acne treatment includes Green Tea, Green Clay and 3% Sulfur. The 3% Sulfur helps clear up and decongest skin while Green Tea and Green Clay help reduce the appearance redness and absorb excess sebum. The mask will clear up your skin in no time while also giving you some fun – it goes on totally green!

Nobody’s skin tone is perfectly even, so it’s normal to have some spots on your face that are a shade lighter or a shade darker than the rest of it — or a slightly different texture. However, some people develop patches that are noticeably different from the rest of their face, and sometimes even makeup won’t cover it. Here’s what you need to know about the causes of uneven skin tone on the face and how to treat it.
Try Our Face Cream for Dark Spots
Causes of Uneven Skin Tone on Face
First of all, you need to figure out what is causing your uneven skin tone. There are many potential causes of uneven skin tone, including sunburn, rosacea, hyperpigmentation, melasma, dry skin, pollution and more. Without identifying the underlying cause(s) of your uneven skin tone, your treatment attempts might not be effective — or worse; they might even exacerbate the problem.
Hyperpigmentation can manifest in multiple ways, including sunspots and dark spots left behind after acne lesions or cuts have healed. Melasma is another form of hyperpigmentation that often occurs during pregnancy and manifests as large patches of brown or gray skin. Dry skin patches will have a different texture and sometimes color from the rest of your face, while rosacea patches will look red and flushed instead.
If you’re not sure what is causing the problem, a professional dermatologist can help you figure it out. In fact, getting an annual exam to check for skin cancer and also diseases is an excellent way to prevent uneven skin tone down the line and contribute to overall skin health. When in doubt, it’s always better to go to a dermatologist to get an expert opinion.

How to Treat Uneven Skin Tone on Face
When it comes to treating uneven skin tone at home, it’s vital that you don’t pick at your skin. This can lead to scarring, hyperpigmentation and other conditions that can make your uneven skin tone worse. Some of these results, such as scarring, can be difficult to impossible to treat, so it’s wise to take steps to prevent them in the first place. If you tend to pick at acne and cuts, try wearing a hydrocolloid bandage over them to stop yourself.
Next, you should wear quality sunscreen absolutely every day, even if you are sitting inside or the weather is cloudy. UV exposure can make conditions such as rosacea and hyperpigmentation worse, so protecting your face from the sun will help to keep these issues from progressing. When shopping for sunscreen, choose an SPF of at least 30, though higher is better. Ideally, you should get a water-resistant formula that won’t come off at the first sign of sweat. Reapply your sunscreen every two hours when outside in the sun.
We also recommend incorporating a vitamin C serum like our Brightening Booster into your morning routine before you apply your sunscreen. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps to protect your skin from free radical damage and may inhibit the production of melanin in the skin as well (melanin is what causes dark spots).

It’s also important that you exfoliate regularly using a face peel or another chemical exfoliator. Dead skin cell patches will worsen the appearance of dark spots and result in the uneven application of makeup or other facial products, making your face appear patchy. Most people need to exfoliate between one to three times a week depending on their skin type, regardless of whether or not they have uneven skin tone. In fact, exfoliating is so essential that we made it the middle step of our 3-step skincare routines. Exfoliating your face should be done at night since it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.
If your dark spots and unevenness persist, then you might want to take things a step further with a face cream for dark spots. These creams contain concentrated ingredients such as hydroquinone that work to fade dark spots faster via topical application.
If none of these strategies work, then you might need to look into getting professional treatments done at a dermatologist’s or licensed esthetician’s office. Possible options include laser treatments such as IPL, clinical-strength peels, microdermabrasion and more. These treatments are usually more effective than at-home treatments because they involve higher concentrations of ingredients and powerful devices such as medical lasers. However, they also have more potential side effects and recovery times can last for weeks.

Combination skin combines oily, normal and dry skin types all at once, which can make it tricky to devise a skincare routine for combination skin. If you’re mystified about what you should and shouldn’t be doing for combination skin, here are our top six dos and don’ts for building a combination skin routine:
Don’t skip the research phase.
There are a lot of myths out there about combination skin, and to make matters more complicated, every single person’s skin is uniquely different. Two people might technically have combination skin, but their ideal skincare routines might not overlap at all. As you start to build your perfect routine for combination skin, take steps to educate yourself and get familiar with your own particular needs before you rush out and buy a million facial cleansers. Seek out advice from well-researched, dermatologist-backed sources as you seek to understand your combination skin.
Do exfoliate regularly.
Exfoliating regularly benefits combination skin in two ways. One, it will help to control excess sebum production in the more oily areas. Two, it will help to get rid of dry patches on the other areas of your face. These two benefits combine to make exfoliating an absolute must for people with combination skin. Depending on how oily and/or sensitive your skin is, you will probably need to exfoliate between one to three times a week. Incorporate a chemical exfoliator such as a glycolic acid face peel into your 3-step skincare routine to get the most effective results.

Don’t skip moisturizer.
People who have oily skin are often taught to fear moisturizer, believing that it will make their face look even shinier. However, anti-aging moisturizers are key for keeping the dry patches on your skin from drying out. What’s more, sometimes your skin is producing so much oil precisely because it’s dry and overcompensating, which means that regularly moisturizing can actually help to make your face less shiny. Apply it generously to your dry patches, but try a lighter hand with the oilier parts of your face.
Do use products on only part of your face.
Combination skin means that one product might not work over your entire face, and that’s totally okay! In fact, using a single product only on select parts of your face is a great tip for building a skincare routine for combination skin. For example, if you have really dry patches, then apply a heavy hydrating serum to them, but skip the oilier parts of your face. Some people also like using two different moisturizers — a lighter one for the more oily parts and a heavier one for the drier parts. Experiment around to see what works for your skin, and don’t be disappointed if a product doesn’t work for your whole face.

Check Out Our Combination Skin Products
Don’t forget to change your routine with the seasons.
Everyone’s skin care needs change with the weather, and this is particularly true with combination skin. Areas of skin that were neither dry nor oily in summer might become dry as a desert once winter rolls in. Patches that are a little bit shiny in winter might become an oil slick in summer, and so on. This means that you need to vary up your skincare routine for combination skin with the seasons in order to get the maximum benefits out of your products. This also goes for travel as well. If you’re headed somewhere with a vastly different climate from your home base, then you might need to pack some different products.
Do keep checking in with your skin.
The needs of combination skin don’t just change temporarily with the weather. They also change permanently over time. The products that worked for you a couple of years ago, or even last year, might not be what your face needs right now. For instance, many people find that their skin becomes less oily as they age, so your combination skin might move towards more of a dry skin type over time. Take stock of your skin every few months to see if everything is still going well, and don’t be afraid to introduce new products at a reasonable pace.

Your face is one of the first places that signs of aging will show up due to the delicacy of the skin there and how much your facial muscles move. While aging is a completely normal part of being human, many people are understandably curious about what they can do to prevent or slow the signs of aging on your face. Today, we’re exploring if it’s ever too early to begin anti-aging skincare and what you should be doing to get started with anti-aging 3-step skincare at home.

When Should You Start an Anti-Aging Skincare Routine?
If you’re wondering when you should start an anti-aging skincare routine, the answer is “as soon as possible.” And, yes, this means that even if you are in your twenties (or even your teens!), it’s never too early to think about helping your skin age gracefully with a quality skincare routine. That’s because one of the biggest contributors to the aging process is sun damage in the early years. Even though you might not feel the immediate impact, except for the occasional sunburn, the cumulative effects of all that sun exposure will result in more wrinkles and saggy skin down the line. Thus, taking a preventative approach when you are young is key to successful anti-aging skincare.
That being said, don’t give up if you are in your thirties or forties (or even older) — it truly is never too late to begin an anti-aging skincare routine. You will still benefit from anti-aging skincare no matter how old you are. However, it’s important to be realistic, especially with what you can achieve with at-home products. If you are older and looking to target existing signs of aging, you should definitely give your skincare routine an upgrade, but you might need to look into getting professional treatments from a dermatologist or esthetician as well.

How to Get Started with Anti-Aging Skincare
If the section above didn’t tip you off, we’re here to tell you that the no. 1 thing you can do for anti-aging, no matter how old you are, is to apply an anti-aging sunscreen every single day. Choose a formula with an SPF of at least 30 and slather your entire face in it as the last step of your morning skincare routine. Reapply it every two hours when you are out in the sun, sweating a lot or getting in the water.
Speaking of protection against the sun, you should also incorporate a vitamin C product into your morning routine after you use your facial cleanser but before you apply your sunscreen. While vitamin C is no substitute for SPF, it does help to protect against environmental damage such as UV rays, free radicals and pollution — all of which contribute to premature aging of the skin.
Retinoids, a large category that includes prescription-strength retinol, are the next ingredient that you should focus on for anti-aging. Retinoid treatments stimulate skin cell turnover and growth, stimulating the production of collagen and elastin and reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. (As a bonus, it’s also been shown to be effective for acne as well. So if you’re struggling with hormonal breakouts in adulthood, you’ll benefit twice from it.) Retinoids make your skin more sensitive to the sun so they should be applied at night.

Dry skin will make fine lines and wrinkles more apparent and just generally make your face look tired and dull. Fortunately, you can combat this using two different types of skincare ingredients. The first is to apply a chemical exfoliator such as our Gentle Exfolitating Peel Pads one to three times a week, depending on your skin’s needs. In fact, exfoliating is so crucial that we made it the middle step of our 3-step skincare set. The second is to use an anti-aging moisturizer both morning and night to prevent water loss from the skin. You might also need to incorporate an extra hydrating serum if your skin is very dry.
Taken together, these ingredients will provide a solid foundation for anti-aging skincare at any age. Prioritize these ingredients during your search for anti-aging skincare and you will be well on your way to slowing preventable signs of aging. And if you’re looking to upgrade your skincare routine, then consider our Lancer Skincare products, which are all based on tried-and-true ingredients like the ones we have listed here.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/how-to-get-rid-of-puffy-eyes-fast/,"Puffy eyes make you look tired and older, not to mention they can be dry and irritating. They’re also pretty common, and pretty much everyone is going to wake up with puffy eyes at least once in their lives. In this guide, we’re exploring what causes puffy eyes, explaining how to get rid of them fast with eye care products and offering tips for preventing puffy eyes in the first place.
What Causes Puffy Eyes?
First of all, we want to clarify that puffy eyes are different from dark-colored under-eye bags, although they can occur at the same time. Having dark patches below your eyes is mostly caused by genetics, and may persist even after you relieve your puffiness.
Puffy eyes are also different from swollen eyes, which are usually a sign of allergies, colds or another medical condition, and are often accompanied by itching and involuntary watering of the eyes. Swollen eyes are treated by addressing the underlying condition. While trying to directly reduce the swelling of your eyes may temporarily relieve your symptoms, if your eyes are swollen instead of puffy, eye swelling won’t completely go away until you address whatever is causing it.
If you’ve determined that you truly have puffy eyes, there are multiple factors that could be causing them. The most common is crying, which irritates the eye area and dehydrates it, resulting in a puffy appearance. Even if you don’t cry, holding back tears can also cause the eye area to appear puffy.

Many people also experience puffy eyes upon first waking up in the morning because the lack of blinking all night has caused fluid to gather around the eye area, which can contribute to a feeling of puffiness. Paradoxically, lack of sleep can also result in puffy eyes because sleep deprivation causes the retention of blood and other fluids in that area specifically.
Eating too much sodium can lead to fluid retention in any part of the body, which also includes puffy eyes. Usually, this will be accompanied by swelling in other parts of the body as well, but not always.
Finally, physical changes due to aging can lead to the appearance of puffy eyes. That’s because as we age, the fat deposits around our eyes begin to break down and the collagen in our skin is not replenished at the same rate. This causes the fat around the eye to move out of place and the skin around the eye to sag. This can sometimes result in a puffy or baggy appearance around the eye area.

How to Get Rid of Puffy Eyes Fast
Woke up with puffy eyes and need to make them go away — fast? Here are five strategies that can make your puffy eyes look better quickly.
Apply a cold compress.
The best way to reduce any kind of swelling fast, including eye puffiness, is to apply some sort of cold compress to the area. There are many different options for this, from the classic ice cube to a cold wash rag to a spoon that has been frozen for a couple of minutes. If you often experience puffy eyes, then you might want to invest in some eye Joe packs or another dedicated item that you can keep in your freezer for regular use. Be sure to sanitize these items before placing them on your face to avoid accidentally transferring germs and bacteria to your eye area, which can potentially lead to infection and make the swelling worse.
Use an eye product with caffeine.
When used in skincare products, caffeine acts as a vasoconstrictor, which means that it will temporarily tighten up blood vessels and reduce the appearance of puffiness and swelling. Some DIY home treatments seek to harness the power of caffeine by placing black teabags directly on the eye area — but you’ll have better results if you choose an eye cream for puffy eyes that contains caffeine instead. Carefully dab the eye cream on the affected area, being careful not to actually get it in your eye. The effect won’t last forever, but it is a great way to temporarily reduce your puffiness and make your face look more awake.

Give yourself a facial massage.
Massage helps stimulate blood flow and reduce fluid retention. Giving your face a gentle massage is a great way to reduce eye puffiness. For best results, first, moisturize the area using a fragrance-free lotion or an eye cream specifically designed for the eye area. Then, using the tips of your fingers, gently massage the swollen area to help stimulate blood flow and reduce swelling. Be extremely gentle with your movements and keep your fingers away from your eyeball. Always wash your hands before touching your face — especially before getting close to your eye area — to prevent infection.
Treat your allergies.
If allergies are contributing to your puffy eyes at all, then treating those allergies will be the fastest way to get rid of your puffy eyes. In many cases, taking an over-the-counter allergy product such as an antihistamine will quickly (though temporarily) treat your symptoms, including puffy eyes. If your allergies are not responsive to over-the-counter treatments, then you may need to seek help from an allergist or other medical expert who can prescribe you a stronger treatment that will help alleviate your allergies, puffy eyes and other related symptoms.
Check your skincare products.
The area around your eyes is extremely sensitive and may react to skincare products that work well for the rest of your face. Your eyes are especially sensitive to fragrance, alcohol, acids and other potentially irritating ingredients. That’s why it’s always a good idea to use products specifically formulated for puffy eyes and be careful about applying other facial products directly to the eye area. If you have been doing that recently, check the ingredient list on those skincare products to see if they include any potentially sensitizing ingredients. If they do, that could be why you have been struggling with puffy eyes. Consider switching to eye care products that are meant to be used in that area.

How to Prevent Puffy Eyes
Puffy eyes often have underlying causes that can’t be treated in just a few minutes. Here are seven lifestyle changes that will help reduce your chances of waking up with puffy eyes.
Get enough sleep.
We know that this is easier said than done, but getting enough sleep really is one of the best ways to both treat and prevent puffy eyes. Most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night, and some people need even more depending on their individual circumstances. If you have trouble falling or staying asleep, try making some changes to your nighttime routine, such as staying away from screens for an hour before bed and making sure to sleep in a completely dark room. Taking melatonin in the short term can help you fall and stay asleep. But it isn’t a long-term solution, so you shouldn’t rely on it indefinitely.
Rethink your sleep position.
If you are getting enough sleep, but still waking up with puffy eyes, then your sleep position might be to blame. If you are a side or stomach sleeper, then you press at least one side of your face into the pillow all night, which can lead to puffiness and swelling, including around the area. Try sleeping on your back without pressing your face to the pillow. You might also want to try slightly elevating your head by sleeping on two pillows stacked on top of each other, which will discourage fluid from draining toward your face and potentially cause a swollen appearance when you first wake up in the morning.
Remove your makeup before sleep.
If you’re not very dedicated about removing your makeup before you sleep, that could also be contributing to your puffy eyes first thing in the morning. Makeup can be very irritating if it gets directly in your eye, and when you sleep, you move around which can cause it to transfer from your face to the pillow and back again. Make it a priority to completely remove your makeup before getting in bed each night, and change your pillowcase often to boot — at least once a week. If you tend to get back late, try keeping some makeup wipes on your nightstand right next to your bed so you don’t have to worry about washing your face in a pinch.

Wear sunscreen.
Wearing sunscreen every day is one of the best ways to prevent age-related skin changes — and that includes puffy eyes. This is because constant exposure to UV rays can hasten the creation of wrinkles and sagging of skin, which contribute to the appearance of puffy eyes. Choose a sunscreen that has at least SPF 30 protection, apply it every day and reapply it every two hours when out in the sun. Be cautious of sunscreens that are high in alcohol, fragrance and other potentially irritating ingredients. If your eyes are extremely sensitive to sunscreen, try a mineral sunscreen, which tends to be less irritating than a chemical sunscreen. Don’t skip putting sunscreen on your eye area though. The skin around your eye is the most delicate of your entire face and will be one of the first areas to start wrinkling.
Stay hydrated.
If you are dehydrated, then your body will retain fluid, which can cause swelling in many different areas of the body, including your eyes. Most people need somewhere between three and four liters of water a day, and some individuals may need more if they sweat a lot. Try to drink at least that much each day. If you don’t like the taste of plain water, you can freeze it with fruits and vegetables to make it taste more exciting without adding sugar or sodium. Be careful of beverages such as caffeine and alcohol that contribute to dehydration. More on alcohol in a later section.
Watch your sodium intake.
Eating too much sodium can cause your body to retain water in an effort to balance it out. Sodium does not only come from table salt but it is also present in many different foods — especially prepackaged foods. If you suspect that your diet is high in sodium, watch how much salt you’re adding to your meals and also check the nutrition labels on your food to see how much sodium they contain. You might be surprised to see that even foods that do not taste salty can actually contain very high levels of sodium. Finding lower sodium substitutes will help to lower your levels and encourage your body to retain less water.

Drink less alcohol.
We love a good cocktail as much as the next person, but, unfortunately, alcohol contributes to dehydration, which in turn can cause your body to retain fluid in both the eye area and the rest of your body. Alcohol also disturbs your sleep cycle, making it harder to both fall and stay asleep and further contributing to puffy eyes. Try to make alcohol drinks an occasional indulgence instead of a regular habit, and don’t be surprised if your eyes start looking less puffy as you start drinking less.

Even people who struggle with oily skin during the hotter months often find their skin drying up during the wintertime. In this guide, we explain how to tell if you have dry skin, the various causes of dry skin, and how to treat dry skin at home before it becomes too severe.
What Does Dry Skin Feel Like?
Dry skin, formally known as xerosis or xeroderma, can occur anywhere on the body. It commonly appears on the hands and face but can also occur on the arms, legs, torso, feet, and pretty much anywhere else. Dry skin can typically be identified visually due to its rough and flaky appearance. More advanced dry skin can lead to scaling, cracking, and peeling, and may even result in bleeding. Dry skin also feels tight, and may make it difficult to move your hands or make facial expressions in severe cases. It may also result in patches of skin with a different color than normal. Fair skin may look red or pink while darker skin may look gray or ashy.

What Causes Dry Skin?
The underlying causes of dry skin are usually either a loss of water moisture or not enough oil (sebum) production — and sometimes both. Some people’s skin tends to be naturally dry already, and your skin tends to become more dry as you age as well, especially after you hit 40.
There are many other environmental factors that can also cause dry skin. Exposure to harsh, cold weather is a major one, which is why many people experience dry skin in winter. Spending lots of time in the sun will worsen dry skin, especially if you get sunburned. Doing wet work that constantly requires you to expose your skin to water — such as nurses washing their hands all the time — will also contribute to dry skin.
Certain health conditions also contribute to dry skin. Having a vitamin deficiency such as vitamin D, vitamin A, niacin, zinc, or iron can lead to dry skin. Dry skin is also a known side effect of diabetes, thyroid disease, kidney disease, dialysis, and certain cancer treatments. Many conditions that affect the skin also cause dryness as a side effect including atopic dermatitis, ichthyosis, perioral dermatitis, psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis.

How to Treat Dry Skin
Most cases of dry skin are very mild and caused by environmental factors, making it very easy to treat at home. However, if you suspect that your dry skin is caused by an underlying medical condition or a nutrient deficiency, reach out to your medical provider to treat the underlying problem. If left untreated, dry skin can eventually lead to skin cracking and bleeding, so it’s important to take care of dry skin when you notice the early symptoms.
If you’re experiencing dry skin, we recommend going through your skincare collection and temporarily hitting pause on products that contain potentially drying ingredients. These include acne skincare products, facial exfoliators with acids, and other products meant for oil control. Once you’ve got your dry skin under control, you can slowly add these back into your routine if you feel like you need them. Be careful not to use exfoliators too often, though. We know it’s tempting to use them constantly in order to remove all the dry flakes, but if you overdo it, then you will just dry your skin out further and make the problem worse.
For now, focus on using gentle facial cleansers that won’t strip your skin’s natural oils, and then follow it up with hydrating serums and heavy moisturizers that will help to lock in that water and keep it from escaping your skin. Search for products that are marketed for dry, sensitive, and/or dehydrated skin, and look for terms like “milk cleanser” and “night cream” which indicate products with a thicker texture that aren’t drying. If you have very dry skin, you might want to finish off your skincare routine with a hydrating oil or even a layer of petroleum jelly (a technique called “slugging”) to really seal everything in. Be aware that these thicker products might not absorb into your skin fully, so you’ll want to do this at night and sleep on an old pillowcase that you don’t mind staining. You should also continue to wear sunscreen during the day, even during cloudy winter weather, because UV ray exposure contributes to dry skin and can make the problem worse.

Acne doesn’t stop once you age out of your teens. Acne is a relatively common skin condition in adulthood, and the treatments that worked when you were a teenager won’t necessarily still be effective. In this guide, we’ll dive into what causes adult acne and how to treat it with acne skincare products once you’re in your 20s and beyond.
What Is Adult Acne?
In some cases, adult acne takes the same form that it did during the teenage years, usually whiteheads (closed plugged pores) and blackheads (open plugged pores). However, adult acne can also take the form of painful, swollen nodules and cysts that start deep within the skin. These are usually red and may or may not come to head with pus eventually. Cysts tend to appear along the cheeks, chin, and jawline while the forehead stays clear. Meanwhile, other types of acne can appear all over the face as well as on the chest, shoulders, and back.

What Causes Adult Acne?
At its most basic level, adult acne is caused by excess oil production that makes pores become clogged by skin cells, forming a lesion. Bacteria and inflammation also contribute to the appearance of acne, causing swelling and redness. There are many different potential underlying causes for this excess sebum production.
Fluctuating hormone levels are one common culprit, and many people find that their acne breakouts become more severe before and during their periods. Some people also find that going on certain types of birth control also worsens their acne (though many others find that birth control actually makes their adult acne better). There is also evidence that stress causes an increase in hormones that ramp up oil production and contribute to acne.
Certain hair and skin products can also clog the pores or result in an irritation or allergic reaction that manifests as acne. If you’ve recently started using a new facial cleanser or lotion, check the labels for potentially irritating ingredients like fragrance and denatured alcohol and pore-clogging ingredients like oil and shea butter. Try eliminating these products from your skincare routine to see if that improves your acne.
In some cases, acne can be a symptom of underlying medical conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome or another endocrine disorder. In these cases, the adult acne will usually be accompanied by other symptoms like hair loss or excess growth, rapid weight loss or gain, and irregular menstrual cycles. If you suspect that your adult acne is merely a symptom of an underlying medical condition, see your doctor to get a formal diagnosis.

How to Treat Adult Acne
Treating acne early is key for preventing scarring and other longer term consequences that are more difficult to address. Thankfully, there are lots of over the counter acne skincare products that you can try at home without a prescription from a doctor. To start, we recommend using a cleansing balm or makeup remover at night to remove makeup and other impurities and then following it up with a gentle foaming facial cleanser. Regular exfoliation two to three times a week will help to clear away dead skin cells that can block your pores. Using a retinol on the other nights will help to improve skin cell turnover, which can also help improve acne.
Follow everything up with an oil-free moisturizer to keep the acne treatments from drying out your skin. In the morning, you should wear sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 to help reduce the appearance of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation spots, which is worsened by UV ray exposure. If you have active acne lesions that you are trying to treat, a sulfur based spot treatment applied directly to the pimple can help to calm the inflammation quickly. While many cases of adult acne can be successfully treated at home, not all cases of adult acne will respond to over the counter products. In these cases, a dermatologist can prescribe stronger medications, including topical antibacterial creams to reduce inflammation, stronger retinoids like tretinoin to improve skin cell turnover, and oral medications like spironolactone to help control hormone levels.

If you’re the type of person who only puts on sunscreen when you go to the beach or sit by the pool, you’ve probably wondered if you really need to wear sunscreen every day. Let’s talk about why daily sunscreen wear is important and what to look for in a daily sunscreen for your face. Then, we’ll get to know the formulations for Lancer Skincare’s various anti-aging sunscreens to help you decide which one is right for you.

Do You Need to Wear Sunscreen Every Day?
The short answer is yes, you do need to wear a sunscreen every day — even if you’re mostly sitting inside, or it’s cloudy outside, or you have deeper skin that doesn’t sunburn. Wearing sunscreen every day is one of the most effective things that you can do in order to prevent visible signs of premature aging and also to lower your risks of skin cancer, which is the most common cancer in the U.S. Your morning 3-step skincare routine should end with an application of sunscreen, and you should be wearing sunscreen on all exposed areas of skin — not just your face, but also your hands, arms, chests, and so on. Ideally, you should reapply the sunscreen every two hours, not just once in the morning. You should also reapply it after sweating and after getting out of the pool or ocean.
The only exception to this rule is babies below six months of age, who have very sensitive skin that tends to react to sunscreen. Instead, they should be kept out of the sun as much as possible until they are old enough to wear sunscreen. Everyone else, including you, should be wearing sunscreen every single day. The only question is which daily sunscreen for the face will work for you!

Choosing a Daily Sunscreen for Your Face
If you don’t wear sunscreen because you believe it’s goopy and unpleasant to apply, think again. These days, there are many advanced sunscreen formulations on the market, many of which absorb fast and reapply easily over themselves. It may take some trial and error to find a long-lasting sunscreen that you enjoy using every day, but it’s worth it to reap the benefits of wearing a daily sunscreen. We recommend choosing a sunscreen of at least SPF 30 that has broad spectrum protection against both UVA and UVB rays. SPF 30 sunscreen typically hits the sweet spot between providing enough protection for daily use while still being thin enough that it absorbs easily (and looks nice under makeup, if you wear it). Both of the sunscreens offered by Lancer Skincare are SPF 30 for this reason. If you tend to sweat a lot, we recommend looking for a water-resistant formula as well.
There are two main categories of sunscreen filters to choose from. Mineral sunscreen filters, sometimes called physical sunscreens, block the sun’s rays from reaching your skin. They include ingredients like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Chemical sunscreens absorb the sun’s rays and include ingredients like avobenzone, oxybenzone, and octisalate. Chemical sunscreens tend to be more moisturizing and result in a thinner, more pleasant texture, but they can also irritate sensitive skin. Mineral sunscreen tends to be less irritating but they can also be a bit drying. Some mineral sunscreens can also leave a white cast behind on darker skin if they aren’t tinted.

Get to Know Lancer’s Daily Sunscreens
At Lancer Skincare, we offer two different sunscreen options to choose from — one mineral sunscreen and one chemical combination sunscreen — both of which provide broad spectrum protection. Our Mineral Sun Shield Universal Tint is tinted to minimize white cast in a versatile shade that complements many different skin tones. In addition to zinc oxide for sun protection, it also features pink rock rose and ginger root extract to soothe skin and reduce inflammation.
Meanwhile, our Sheer Fluid Sun Shield is actually a combination mineral-chemical sunscreen, featuring both zinc oxide and octinoxate for comprehensive protection. Its ingredients also include gamay grape stem cells, sunflower sprout extracts, and chamomile extracts to calm skin and improve radiance. Due to the lower zinc oxide content, this sunscreen absorbs right into the skin without a white cast, so it doesn’t need to be tinted.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-a-morning-skincare-routine/,"Having a morning skincare routine won’t just get your day started on a great note — it’s one of the foundational blocks of great skincare habits. If you’d rather hit snooze several times than navigate a complicated skin routine, rest assured that your morning skincare routine doesn’t need to be time-consuming or overly complex. In this ultimate guide, we will break down everything that you need to know about putting together the perfect morning skincare routine for your unique skin — from choosing a long-lasting sunscreen to deciding whether or not eye care products are important.
Get to know your skin type.
While every person’s skin is unique, most people fall into one of five major skin type categories: dry, oily, combination, sensitive and normal. Understanding these skin types and which one(s) you fit best is key for putting together a skincare routine that works for your face, both in the morning and at night. For example, using products meant for oily skin on a dry face will only lead to irritation and redness, while using products meant for dry skin on an oily face can clog your pores and cause extra shine. If you’re not sure what your skin type is, do a basic skin type test at home to help you start narrowing down your options and put together the perfect morning skincare routine.

Understand the basic skincare steps.
Do you ever feel overwhelmed by elaborate 11-step skincare routines that you see on TikTok and YouTube? Don’t be put off by the idea that your morning skincare needs to be a complicated hour-long ritual because it doesn’t. In a nutshell, every skincare routine really only needs to consist of three steps: cleansing, treatment and moisturizing (plus sunscreen in the morning). That’s why we have made 3-step skincare sets the foundation of our Lancer Skincare. Obviously, there are additional products that you can add in beyond these steps that will be beneficial — but even if you only stick with the three basic steps, you will still see results from your morning skincare routine if you are consistent.
Know that you don’t have to use a cleanser.
Double cleansing in the evening with a makeup remover and then a facial cleanser is non-negotiable. You need to remove sunscreen, makeup, dirt, pollution and other debris that can gunk up your pores before you hit the sack. However, in the morning, it’s really up to your discretion whether or not you want to cleanse your face using a wash or not. Some people with sensitive or extra dry skin like to stick with a gentle micellar water to avoid stripping their face, while people with oily skin often find using a morning face wash to be beneficial for skin management. We do recommend rinsing your face at the very least to remove the products you put on during your nighttime routine. This will ensure that you are applying your morning skincare products to a bare face, allowing them to penetrate the skin more effectively and get you results quicker.

Apply leave-on products from thinnest to thickest.
If you’re the kind of person who enjoys putting on a dozen different products in the morning, it can be difficult to determine what order they should be applied. A great rule of thumb to follow for any skincare routine is that leave-on products should be applied in order from thinnest to thickest. If you use a more watery toner or essence, apply that first and then follow it up with serums, a moisturizer and, finally, sunscreen. Applying a super thick lotion before a serum will stop the serum from getting to the skin as much as it should, so by following this guideline, you’ll be maximizing your chances that your products will work effectively.

Prioritize antioxidants for your treatment.
When it comes to choosing a serum for your morning treatment, we recommend prioritizing antioxidants, specifically vitamin C. Vitamin C helps to protect your skin from free radical damage caused by sun and pollution exposure during the day. Ascorbic acid is the most potent form of vitamin C and is the most well-studied form as well, but it can be sensitizing for some people due to its potency. It’s also unstable and breaks down quickly, so it needs to be formulated well and stowed properly, away from sunlight. If you have easily irritated skin and/or tend to leave open skincare bottles out on your counter, look for a gentle and more stable vitamin C derivative. it won’t be as powerful, but you’ll still get some benefits without the drawbacks.
Top it off with a lightweight moisturizer.
Wearing a moisturizer day and night is key for preventing water loss from the skin and maintaining a plump, youthful appearance.  Many people prefer to use a lighter-weight product in the morning so that it absorbs easily while still preventing water loss from the skin. If you have oily skin, try to find a gel moisturizer for use in the morning. If you want something a little heavier than a gel moisturizer (but don’t want to jump up to heavy cream), then go for a midnight lotion instead. So if you’ve been skipping moisturizer in the morning because it makes your face sticky during the day, then you’ve been using the wrong moisturizer! 

Consider adding in an eye cream.
Like the toner, an eye cream is a bonus product that isn’t strictly necessary for your morning skincare routine but can still make a big impact nonetheless. Eye creams can be especially beneficial if you suffer from puffy eyes and/or under-eye bags right when you first wake up. Eye creams moisturize the skin, helping to smooth out fine lines, plumping up the skin and giving you a great base over which to apply your eye makeup. If you are looking to take your morning routine to the next level, definitely look at adding some eye care products to take care of the delicate skin of your eye area.
Try Our Long-Lasting Sunscreen
Finish up with sunscreen — always.
Sunscreen should always be the last step of your morning skincare routine. Even if it’s cloudy outside, or even if you plan to stay indoors all day, you will still be exposed to UV rays that will accelerate the visible aging process. Protecting yourself from cumulating UV damage every single day will help to delay the aging process and keep you looking youthful for many years to come. Choose a long-lasting sunscreen with at least SPF 30 (though higher protection is never a bad thing). Either mineral or chemical sunscreens are great options. Select the one that you will be motivated to wear every day. Reapply every two hours when you are outside, sweating and/or getting in the water.
Avoid certain ingredients in the daytime.
Certain ingredients can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, especially when used as a leave-on treatment, which is why it’s better to use them at night than in the morning. Retinoids as well as chemical exfoliators (both AHAs and BHAs) are the two most popular categories of ingredients that make your skin sensitive to the sun. They are usually okay in a morning wash-off treatment, such as a cleanser, since they’re only on your face for a few seconds in that case. However, we recommend waiting to use leave-on treatments with these ingredients until the evening when you don’t have to worry about sun exposure.

Give the products time to absorb.
If your morning skincare products are pilling or otherwise causing issues, you might not be giving them enough time to absorb before slathering another layer on your face. We recommend waiting at least 60 seconds between each step before applying the next products. You might also want to wait longer before and after applying your sunscreen for better results. If you wear makeup, we suggest waiting at least five full minutes after applying the sunscreen to ensure that it will be fully set before you apply your primer and/or foundation. This will stop your makeup from sliding around and help to keep your face in place.
Make sure your products play well with your makeup.
Speaking of makeup, using the wrong skincare products with the wrong makeup products can quickly turn a perfect beat into a melting mess. Taking a close look at the ingredient labels will reveal whether or not your products are compatible. Silicone-based skincare products should be worn beneath silicone-based makeup, and water-based skincare products should be worn beneath water-based makeup. If you try to wear silicone makeup with water-based skincare (or vice versa), they will repel each other and quickly ruin your makeup, through no fault of your own. They just aren’t chemically compatible.
Don’t forget about your body!
The face gets a lot of attention when it comes to creating a morning skincare routine, and with good reason. However, it can be nice to include the body in your morning skincare routine, whether that’s putting on hand cream to combat cracked cuticles, applying some glycolic acid body lotion to rough elbows or spritzing yourself with some perfume. If you are still working to establish your morning skincare routine for your face, then these add-ons can be fun bonuses for lazy weekend mornings when you have more time and aren’t rushing to work.
At Lancer Skincare, we sell research-backed skincare products featuring tried-and-true ingredients that will get you results. From three-step skincare sets to long-lasting sunscreen to eye products, we offer everything that you need to put together a gentle yet effective skincare routine for both morning and night. Try our products and get free shipping on your U.S. order, plus a 100 percent satisfaction guarantee so that you can buy with confidence.

The Ultimate Guide to a Morning Skincare Routine was last modified:  March 10th, 2023 by [email protected]",The Ultimate Guide to a Morning Skincare Routine,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/understand-the-basic-skincare-steps.jpg
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/how-to-exfoliate-skin-6-different-ways/,"Years ago, your only option for exfoliating your face was using a washcloth. Nowadays, the beauty industry has exploded with various skincare products and tools that can be used to exfoliate your face. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the pros and cons of six different ways to exfoliate your skin: cleansing with a face wash, using a scrub, applying a leave-on treatment or serum, trying a wash-off mask, using a traditional washcloth, and upgrading to a cleansing brush. If you’re new to exfoliating, be sure to check out our guide that explains how often you should exfoliate, plus other tips for exfoliating your skin. And don’t forget to browse our selection of tried-and-true skin exfoliators!
How to Exfoliate Skin with an Exfoliating Wash
Exfoliating washes are facial cleansers that contain alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), and polyhydroxy acids (PHAs). These chemical exfoliators work to dissolve the bonds between dead skin cells to wash them away. Some exfoliating washes also incorporate capsules or granules that physically brush away dead skin cells, although this is more common in face scrubs than washes (more on that in a minute).
Exfoliating washes are a good choice if you are looking to simplify your skincare routine and want to skip a separate exfoliating step. They are also a great choice for people with sensitive skin who find that other, stronger exfoliating treatments irritate their face. Because exfoliating washes are only on your face for about 60 seconds at a time, they may be less irritating than other options on this list. Some people can even tolerate using an exfoliating wash every day, while most other treatments can only be used one to three times a week.
To exfoliate your skin with an exfoliating wash, start by removing your makeup and sunscreen completely with a makeup remover. Once your face is clean and bare, dispense roughly a dime-size amount of the exfoliating cleanser into your palm and work it into a lather in between your hands. Then gently massage it over your face for one minute total, paying special attention to any areas where you have more pronounced dry patches. Don’t open your eyes, as the exfoliating wash will make them burn. Once the minute is up, rinse your face off with warm (not hot) water and proceed with the rest of your shower or skincare routine.

How to Exfoliate Skin with a Scrub or Polish
Scrubs are one of the most popular ways to exfoliate your skin. Scrubs have a rough texture that harnesses the power of physical exfoliation to clear away dead skin cells. Some of them also contain AHAs, BHAs, PHAs, and fruit enzymes so that you get the benefits of chemical exfoliation as well. For example, all of our Lancer Skincare polishes combine both physical and chemical exfoliation for very effective results.
Scrubs are very effective and simple to use, but they may be too harsh for extremely sensitive skin. You should also skip scrubs (and, really, any kind of exfoliation) if you have any open cuts, scrapes, or acne lesions, since the exfoliation can cause them to become irritated or infected. Scrubs can be used between one to seven times a week, depending on your skin tolerance.
To exfoliate your skin with a face scrub, start by removing your makeup and washing your face with a non-exfoliating cleanser. Depending on the product directions, you may apply the scrub directly to wet skin, or you may need to pat your face dry first. If the product can be applied to damp skin, you may find it easier to use the scrub in the shower so you can just rinse it away without worrying about getting messy.
Dispense about a nickel’s worth of product into your palm, and then gently spread it across your face, rubbing in small circles. Don’t put too much pressure on your skin or scrub too hard, and avoid the eyes and lips. Massage the scrub into your warm for a minute or so, and then rinse off the product with warm (not hot) water. Pat your face dry and follow it up with a nourishing serum and moisturizer.

Try a Face Peel
How to Exfoliate Skin with a Leave-On Treatment
Leave-on exfoliating treatments and serums have exploded in popularity within the past few years. These skincare products use AHAs, BHAs, and PHAs to dissolve dead skin cells through the power of chemical exfoliation. Because they are designed to be left on the skin overnight, they typically contain lower concentrations of these ingredients than a wash-off mask or scrubs.
Leave-on exfoliating serums are available in all different formulas, from super-potent glycolic acid toners that work for oily skin to very gentle mandelic acid serums that for sensitive skin. If you are new to the world of leave-on chemical exfoliants, it’s best to start with a lower concentration and a gentler ingredients (such as polyhydroxy acids) that have a lower risk of irritating your face. If your skin does well, then you can work on building your tolerance for higher concentrations and stronger ingredients over time.
To exfoliate your skin with a leave-on treatment, start by removing your makeup and washing your face with a non-exfoliating cleanser, and then dry your face off completely. You can either apply the exfoliating serum directly to your bare skin, which will result in the most effective exfoliation, or you can put down a hydrating serum first if you have very sensitive skin. Apply a thin layer of serum all over your face, and then follow it up with a moisturizer to seal it in.
We recommend applying a leave-on exfoliator only at night, since it can make your skin much more sensitive to sun damage during the day. You should not use a leave-on exfoliator in the same routine as other powerful active ingredients, such as vitamin C and retinol, which will greatly increase your odds of irritating your skin. Some itching and tingling are normal when you first apply the product, but if your face burns or hurts, then you should immediately rinse off the product and discontinue use. If you’re looking for a more simple routine outside of a leave on treatment, our Gentle Exfoliating Peel Pads are another great way to exfoliate your skin! These pads are gentle and easy to use and are perfect if you’re travelling or on the go. 

How to Exfoliate Skin with a Wash-Off Mask
Exfoliating masks and face peels are potent products that use chemical exfoliation to provide quick, effective results. These wash-offs masks can contain 30% or more AHAs and BHAs. Because the concentration is so high, they are typically designed to be used no more than once a week and left on for no more than 10 minutes at a time.
Exfoliating masks can’t get the same results as an in-office chemical peel offered by a dermatologist, but they are usually the strongest at-home exfoliating products available. As such, they are best used by veteran skincare aficionados who know that their skin has a high tolerance for exfoliating products. People with sensitive skin or those new to exfoliating should try a scrub or gentle leave-on serum first to get a better gauge of their skin’s tolerance.
To exfoliate your skin with a wash-off face peel like our Caviar Lime Acid Peel, start by removing your makeup and washing your face with a non-exfoliating cleanser. In most cases, you will need to dry your face off completely before applying the mask, but read the package directions to make sure. Apply a thin layer of product all over your face, avoiding the eyes and lips completely.
Never leave an exfoliating mask on for longer than the package directions state. If you have never used the product before, to prevent irritation we recommend leaving it on for as little as one minute before rinsing it off. Over time, you can build your tolerance until your skin can handle leaving the mask on for the full amount of time. When you’re done with the mask, thoroughly rinse off your face with warm (not hot) water and pat it dry. Follow it up with a nourishing serum and moisturizer to soothe your skin.

How to Exfoliate Skin with a Washcloth
Washcloths were basically the original exfoliating treatment; the rough surface of the fabric wipes away dead skin cells using physical exfoliation. While there are plenty of more advanced treatments available today, some people prefer the old-school method of using a washcloth to exfoliate. Washcloths are inexpensive, and most people already have them lying around the house, so they are very accessible.
For best results, use a clean washcloth every time to avoid contamination with germs. If possible, we recommend having dedicated washcloths that you only use for your face if you are set on using a washcloth to exfoliate your face. Washcloths are also an awesome option for exfoliating your body (which is less sensitive than your face), but it’s better to use separate washcloths for that.
To exfoliate your face with a washcloth, start by removing your makeup and sunscreen completely with a makeup remover. Once your face is clean and bare, put some face wash on the washcloth and gently move it in circles on your face. Don’t press too hard or scrub vigorously; your movements should be gentle and soft. Do this for about 60 seconds, moving all over your face and concentrating on the most pronounced dry patches. Once the minute is up, rinse off your face with warm (not hot) water and rinse out the washcloth.

How to Exfoliate Skin with an Exfoliating Device
Exfoliating devices are basically the modern-day, high-tech version of a washcloth’s physical exfoliation. Our Microdermabrasion device features a patented 180 degree swivel neck effective for targeting hard to reach areas and 3 vacuum suction settings for customized exfoliation on different areas of the face and body. Our device also comes with 200 disposable filters to trap dead skin and keep the device in optimal condition, tweezers for replacing filters and one travel pouch. Maintaining your device will ensure maximum exfoliation and use. 
To exfoliate your face with our exfoliating device, start by removing your makeup and sunscreen completely with a makeup remover. Once your face is clean and bare, apply a small-size amount of face wash to the head of the brush and turn it on. Move the brush gently around your face, starting on your forehead and working your way down. Keep the brush away from your eyes and lips, which are very delicate. Do this for about 60 seconds total, and then turn off the brush and rinse both your face and the brush with warm (not hot) water.

How to Exfoliate Skin 6 Different Ways was last modified:  March 8th, 2023 by [email protected]",How to Exfoliate Skin 6 Different Ways,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/how-to-exfoliate-with-a-polish.jpg
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/skincare-gift-ideas/,"Everybody needs skincare in their lives, which is why skincare products and tools are the perfect gift idea. Whether you are shopping for a birthday gift for a beauty aficionado or a Christmas gift for a skincare newbie, there’s a product out there for them. We’ve rounded up the ultimate list of the best skincare gift ideas for any occasion — from glycolic acid peels to gua sha stones:
Facial Cleansers
Facial cleansers are the foundation of any skincare routine, which is why they’re a great choice for a present. Many people struggle with dry, dehydrated skin during the winter, making a calming milk or cream cleanser an excellent option. However, some people with very oily skin still prefer a gel or foaming cleanser for shine control, even in the colder months. Since you’re planning to give this as a gift, seek out a facial cleanser with elevated formulations and beneficial ingredients, such as those offered by Lancer Skincare.
Face Peels and Exfoliators
Face exfoliators and their stronger cousin, facial peels, aren’t usually a daily step for most people, but they are an important part of a weekly skincare routine. Even though lots of people cut back on exfoliating during the winter, lest it dries out their skin too much, regularly exfoliating with a quality product is still necessary for dissolving dry flakes and smoothing out skin texture. Peels and exfoliators should always be followed up with a moisturizer, which gives you an easy pairing to complement this gift.

Moisturizers and Lotions
Even if your recipient has very oily skin, having an anti-aging moisturizer or lotion in their skincare routine is an absolute must during the wintertime. Thankfully, you can choose from formulations across a spectrum — from very lightweight gel cream that melts into the skin to heavy night creams that are designed to repair the skin barrier. Look for ceramides, peptides, hyaluronic acid, and other beneficial ingredients to hydrate and moisturize the skin.
Shop for Anti-Aging Moisturizers
Facial Oils
Facial oils like our Omega Hydrating Oil, are by no means a required step in any skincare routine, but they can be a luxurious addition to the wintertime months, especially for people with dry skin. Facial oils help to form an occlusive barrier on your skin, preventing water loss and locking in your other facial products to make them even more effective. Many people also find the texture of facial oils much more pleasant to use than other alternatives such as petroleum jelly — plus, the oils instantly give the skin a glow. Your recipients can either mix the facial oil into their moisturizer or apply it alone as the last layer of their skincare routine.
Daily Sunscreen
Wearing sunscreen every day (yes, even during the winter!) is the single best thing that you can do to fend off visible signs of aging — and who doesn’t want to give the gift of anti-aging? If your gift recipients haven’t yet joined the daily sunscreen train, consider presenting them with a highly wearable, non-greasy sunscreen such as those offered by Lancer Skincare. If they have darker skin, choose either a chemical sunscreen or a mineral sunscreen with a tint to avoid accidentally giving them a white cast, which will definitely not encourage them to keep wearing sunscreen.
Eye Care Products
While you can use most facial products on your eyes, it’s nice to have dedicated eye care products to make sure that the delicate skin around your eyes is getting the care that it needs. We especially enjoy using a luxurious eye cream in winter to ensure that our eyes stay hydrated and to protect against fine lines. If your recipients tend to wear a lot of makeup, also consider gifting them a dedicated eye makeup remover to make it much easier to wash their faces after a long day at work.

Lip Balms and Masks
The skin on your lips is pretty sensitive, and it’s also exposed to lots of irritants in the form of food, drinks, and cold weather. That’s one of the reasons your lips tend to be one of the first parts of your body to dry out and get chapped during cold and dry weather — and why lip balms and masks are one of the best skincare gift ideas. Lip balms are more for everyday use, while lip masks are designed for sleeping and feature a thicker texture and more nourishing ingredients to protect against water loss for a longer period of time.
Skincare Kits
Not sure what kinds of products your friend is missing from their skincare shelf? Skincare kits featuring mini-size products are a great solution that allows them to sample many different products without committing them to full-size bottles. Mini 3-step skincare kits are also incredibly convenient for travel since most of them are designed to pass TSA carry-on standards and take up very little room in a suitcase as a result. 
Get the 3-Step Method
Hand Cream
Your hands are prone to drying out and cracking when it’s cold, and you may also experience dry hands if you wash your hands frequently. No matter the time of year, it’s imperative to apply hand lotion every time you wash your hands and especially before you go to sleep at night. That’s also why hand cream is one of our go-to skincare gifts. Even if they already own some, they could always use another tube to keep in their purse, car console, or nightstand. Also, consider giving them a pair of gloves (if they don’t already own one) to protect their skin from the elements when they have to go out in inclement weather.
Reusable Eye Masks
Eye masks are the perfect addition to an extra-long Sunday evening skincare routine, and they can also reduce puffiness and eye bags first thing in the morning as well. We’re especially big fans of reusable eye masks, which can be used many times instead of having to be thrown out after one use. These eye masks are usually made of cooling gel and can be popped into the fridge or even the freezer for instant de-puffing benefits that will make your recipient look more awake in minutes.

Face Rollers
Face rollers and globes are a skincare trend that’s here to stay, which is why they frequently top lists of the top skincare gift ideas. These skincare devices come in many designs—from jade face rollers to skin globes that can be chilled in the fridge before use. For a slight twist, consider a gua sha, which comes in various curved shapes that are especially suited to the face. Not only are these tools cooling and soothing, but many people claim that they help skincare products absorb better and also promote lymphatic drainage.
LED Face Wand or Mask
Many dermatologist offices now offer LED (light emitting diode) treatments to help treat acne, fine wrinkles, and more. While at-home LED tools don’t offer the same potency, they can result in benefits with consistent use over time. LED skincare tools come in wand and mask models, depending on your recipient’s needs. Wands are more portable and more affordable, but they take longer to treat the whole face, making them better for targeted treatments. LED face masks are more expensive and take up more space, but they require less time to treat your entire face and neck.
Microdermabrasion Tools
Microdermabrasion involves sanding off the top, uneven layer of skin to reveal smoother, newer-looking skin underneath. While in-office treatments are the most effective, you can also see results with at-home microdermabrasion tools like the one offered by Lancer Skincare. These tools allow you to do light microdermabrasion in the comfort of your own home whenever it is convenient for you, making it easy to stick to a consistent schedule that will help you see results eventually. The at-home treatment requires little to no downtime (unlike office treatment), and many people see visible results immediately.
Skincare Fridge
A skincare fridge is truly a gift for the person who owns everything. While a skincare fridge is by no means necessary for an effective skincare routine, it does keep your products and tools at a pleasantly cool temperature. A dedicated skincare mini fridge is way more hygienic than putting your skincare in your regular fridge with all the food. Look for a small, energy-efficient model that won’t take up too much counter space. For bonus points, choose a design and color that will complement their existing bathroom decor for a harmonious addition.
Silk Pillowcase
If your friend struggles with pillow scars in the morning that won’t go away for hours, consider gifting them some real silk pillowcases. The smooth finish of silk is easy on the skin and won’t cause creases, so your recipients will wake up looking fresh even if they’re side sleepers. As an added bonus, silk pillowcases are also great for preserving hairstyles because they don’t catch and snag the hair the way that more textured fabrics do, making this a two-in-one gift perfect for friends who are obsessed with all things beauty.

Facial Steamer or Humidifier
A steam facial is an easy way to open up your pores and help yourself relax. While the old “pour boiling water in a shallow bowl” trick always works, you can elevate your friend’s steam facial routine by giving them an at-home facial steamer that makes the whole process as easy as pushing a button. Consider a humidifier that puts moisture back into the air for a slightly more versatile gift. This is a must for dry climates and can be a real savior for seriously cracked skin that isn’t responding to topical products alone.
Looking for high-quality skincare products to give to your friends, family, and other loved ones? At Lancer Skincare, we offer premium products featuring tried-and-tried ingredients and effective formulations developed by celebrity dermatologist Dr. Harold Lancer. All of our orders come with free, fast shipping within the United States so that you can rest assured you will get your gifts on time!

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/tips-for-perfecting-your-anti-aging-skincare-routine/,"It’s never too late or too early to put together the best skincare routine for anti-aging. In fact, the earlier you start thinking about anti-aging, the more effective your skincare routine will be. To help you put together the perfect skincare regimen for your needs, we’ve rounded up seven essential ingredients that any anti-aging skincare routine should include. Then we’ll cover 10 steps (both necessary and optional) that you should consider when putting together an anti-aging skincare routine.
What are the key ingredients for an anti-aging skincare routine?
Certain ingredients form the building blocks of an anti-aging skincare routine, no matter what specific products that you use. Prioritizing evidence-backed ingredients instead of vague marketing claims will also ensure that the products you have chosen will actually deliver the anti-aging benefits they have promised. Here are the ingredients that you should prioritize if you are looking to prevent or treats signs of premature aging:

Retinol: Retinol and retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that increase your skin cell turnover, which encourages cell regeneration and helps to prevent or reduce fine lines and wrinkles. It can also help to treat adult acne by unclogging pores and getting rid of dead skin cells.
Vitamin C: Vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps to protect your skin from free radical damage that can exacerbate the signs of aging. 
Ceramides: Ceramides work to maintain and repair the skin’s natural barrier, locking in moisture and helping to prevent water loss that can dry out your skin. This is important because sebum production slows down as we age, so it’s important to keep skin hydrated.



Hyaluronic acid: Hyaluronic acid is a humectant that attracts water, helping to keep the skin hydrated and plump looking. This also helps to counteract the lower production of sebum that we mentioned above.
Collagen: Collagen is a protein that helps to improve skin elasticity and fill in visible wrinkles. Some people like to take collagen supplements, and you can find it as an ingredient in topical skincare products as well.
Peptides: Peptides are amino acids that form the building blocks of important skin proteins like collagen and elastin. Having peptides in your skincare products can help to promote healthy, smooth skin.
Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs): AHAs form a family of chemical exfoliators that help to dissolve the bonds between dead skin cells, allowing them to be washed away and exposing smooth, glowing skin. Dry skin worsens the appearances of wrinkles and fine lines, so regularly exfoliating with AHAs makes them less apparent.

To avoid overwhelming your skin, look for products that contain multiple ingredients at once. For instance, you can find single skin-tightening creams that contain ceramides, hyaluronic acid, collagen, and peptides for a powerful moisturizer, instead of looking for four separate products that contain each ingredient on their own.
Be sure to pay attention to the ingredient concentrations as well. Some products only put a tiny percentage of an active ingredient in the formulation so they can market it as being “made with vitamin C” and so on. Pay close attention to the labels to see how much of an ingredient a product contains; the higher the percentage, the closer it will be listed to the top of the label. Some brands are also very transparent about the concentrations that their products contain; i.e., 10% glycolic acid.

Discover Our 3-Step Skincare Set
What are the steps in an anti-aging skincare routine?
Now that you know what ingredients to look for, it’s time to discuss what products to include in your anti-aging skincare routine. Here are both the required and optional steps to help you put together the ultimate routine:
Makeup remover
Removing your makeup and sunscreen at the end of the day is an important first step in your nighttime routine. Leaving makeup residue on your face can cause dryness, clog pores, and increase the look of fine lines and wrinkles. Removing makeup and sunscreen completely also ensures that your other skincare products are applied directly to your skin, improving their penetration and making your overall skincare routine more effective.
If you wear a lot of makeup and/or a water-resistant sunscreen, look for a cleansing balm or oil cleanser that can remove heavy-duty products. If you wear a non-water-resistant sunscreen, then a micellar water might suffice for your makeup removal needs. Makeup removing wipes are also a great option especially if you’re short on time or are traveling! 

Cleanser
In the morning, you can either rinse your face with clean water if it’s very sensitive and dry or wash it with a cleanser to remove any residue that accumulated overnight. At night, you should alway follow your makeup remover with a quality facial cleanser to wash away any last traces of dirt and debris and ensure that you start your routine with a fresh, clean face.
If you have already noticed that your skin is producing less oil as you age, then we recommend switching to a gentle cream or milk cleanser that won’t strip the skin. Foaming and gel cleansers are great for oil control, but they are often too harsh for aging skin, so you might find that they leave your face feeling dry and tight. After cleansing, your face shouldn’t feel like it still has a residue on it, but it also shouldn’t feel dried out either.
Also be careful to wash your face with lukewarm or cold water, not hot water. Hot water will further dry out the skin and exacerbate signs of aging, so try to keep the temperature down when you can.
Face mask
Anti-aging face masks are an optional part of your routine, but they can be a nice addition to your routine. Some people like to do them every day, while others save them for a longer skincare routine on the weekend. Face masks can do many different things for your skin depending on the ingredients; choose from hydrating, brightening, exfoliating, or soothing depending on your needs.
Face masks also come in several different formulations, including sheet masks that you stick to your face and creams that you smear on your skin, allow to dry out, and then rinse off. Choose whichever style of masks suits your preferences, or switch between them to add some variety to your skincare routine.

Protect Your Face with Quality Sunscreen
Serum
Serums are the powerhouses of the skincare routine, offering strong active ingredients that can make a serious difference in the appearance of your skin when applied consistently over time. For an anti-aging skincare routine, we recommend choosing a vitamin C serum in the morning to protect against free radical damage from UV rays and dirt. At night, we suggest choosing a retinol serum to encourage skin cell turnover and reduce the appearance of fine lines.
There are plenty of other types of serums to choose from as well, but we recommend being selective of what serums you include in your routine to avoid overdoing it on active ingredients. Look for single serums that incorporate multiple ingredients for an effective and well-balanced approach to skincare.
Exfoliator
Exfoliators come in many different forms — including cleansers, face masks, serums, and scrubs — so you can choose the ones that work best for you. Exfoliators contribute to an anti-aging skincare routine because they remove dead skin cells and dry patches that can worsen the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. Most people need to exfoliate between one to three times a week depending on their skin’s individual needs and how powerful the exfoliating product is.

Moisturizer
Moisturizers are a key part of any anti-aging skincare routine because they help to counteract the slowdown in oil production that occurs as we age. Look for skin-tightening creams that contain beneficial ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, peptides, and marula oil. Many people prefer to use a lighter cream during the day so that it won’t pill underneath their makeup, and then switch to a heavier cream at night to help prevent water loss from the skin while they sleep.
Eye cream
Eye creams aren’t a strictly necessary part of an anti-aging skincare routine — you can just apply your regular moisturizer around your eyes if you want. However, they are a great addition if you are starting to notice fine lines forming around your eyes. The skin around your eyes is extremely thin and delicate, which is why it’s one of the first parts of your face to show signs of aging. Eye creams that contain powerful ingredients such as retinol are also specifically formulated so that they won’t irritate your eyes, which is a big plus.
Sunscreen
If you only do one step of your anti-aging skincare routine, then it should be applying sunscreen in the morning. That’s because exposure to UV rays is the no. 1 contributing factor to visible signs of aging such as fine lines and wrinkles, not to mention it increases your risk of skin cancer. Choose a sunscreen that offers protection of at least SPF 30, and higher if you’d like, and apply the recommended amount to all of your exposed skin, including your neck and ears.
Sunscreen should be worn every day, even when you are sitting indoors; windows don’t do a very good job of blocking UV rays. If you are outside, sweating, or getting in the water, then it should be reapplied every two hours. Also try to limit your sun exposure, especially when the sun is at its peak between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Seek shade whenever you can, and try to cover your exposed skin with hats, sunglasses, and clothing that offers UPF protection.

Facial oil
Facial oil is another optional step in your skincare routine, but it can be a beneficial addition if you have very dry skin, especially in the winter. Facial oils can be applied over your moisturizer or mixed into the cream before applying it, as you prefer. We suggest only applying facial oil at night because it can compromise the formulation of sunscreens and makeup, causing them to break down prematurely.

Whether it’s Mother’s Day or her birthday, skincare is the perfect gift for your mom. No matter your mom’s age, an anti-aging skincare routine is always a great choice to help prevent and treat signs of aging like fine lines and wrinkles. If your mom already has her daily skincare routine figured out, consider an add-on such as a weekly face peel or a hydrating mask that she can use as needed. She might also appreciate a skincare tool such as an at-home microdermabrasion pen that will help her maintain her results in between trips to the dermatologist or aesthetician.
Skincare Gifts for Older Women
If you have a grandmother or older aunt on your shopping list, skincare for wrinkles is always a good idea. If you have the budget for it, powerful treatments such as our LegacyTM line will help them to see faster results at home, thanks to cutting edge ingredients. You can also find more affordable options like our advanced line of skincare treatments, such as our Triple Peptides Drops and Active Rejuvenation Serum. 
If your older loved one is new to skincare, offer to come over for a girl’s night to demonstrate the products for her while spending quality time together. And if she loves to travel in her golden years, give her a skincare travel kit that will fit in her carry-on to make flying easier.
Skincare Gifts for Younger Women
Gone are the days when nobody worried about their skincare routine until they hit middle age: Younger generations are the driving force behind the expansion of the skincare industry. If you are shopping for younger women, such as your daughter or niece, consider getting her skincare products from a nicer brand than she would normally buy so she can pamper herself a little. You should also consider giving her an anti-aging sunscreen as a present, since wearing sunscreen every day is one of the most effective things that you can do to prevent signs of premature aging.

Skincare Gifts for Men
Who says that women should get all the benefits of skincare? While skincare is undoubtedly more popular among women, the truth is that men can benefit from it just as much as women. A simple 3-step skincare routine will help men to cleanse and nourish their skin while sunscreen will protect it from the elements. Men who shave regularly don’t need to exfoliate as much — the razor manually removes dead skin cells — but they do need to cleanse and moisturize every day just like anyone else.

Tips for Buying the Best Skincare Gifts
No matter who you’re shopping for, there is some advice to keep in mind when buying skincare gifts for other people. Here are our top tips for shopping for skincare gifts for other people:

Get to know their skincare preferences before deciding what to buy them. For instance, some people love heavily perfumed products, while others only use fragrance-free products. By prioritizing their preferences, you’re sure to pick skincare products they will love.
Fill in the gaps in their skincare routine by avoiding duplicate products. If they already own an exfoliator, then get them a face mask or a hydrating serum instead. This will ensure that your gifts get used right away rather than sitting in their medicine cabinet until they finish up their current products.
Order from their favorite brands when in doubt of what to buy. Odds are that if they loved one product from a brand, they will love their other items as well. You can always get skincare travel kits or smaller sample sizes if you don’t want to commit to full-size products.
Buy from reputable stores with good exchange policies so they can swap out the products if necessary. For instance, Lancer Skincare offers a 30-day money-back guarantee on all products so that you can shop with confidence for both yourself and your gift recipients.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/what-is-a-chemical-face-peel/,"By elenavolf / Shutterstock.com
You’ve no doubt heard of a chemical face peel before — but do you know what a face peel does? Chemical face peels are available as both at-home and in-office treatments, and they can help to address a variety of skincare concerns. To help you decide whether a chemical peel might work for you or not, we’ll explain what a chemical face peel is and what treatments are available in this quick guide.
What is a chemical face peel?
A chemical face peel treatment is used to remove the top layers of skin by using chemicals to dissolve the bonds between dead skin cells. The most common chemicals used in this treatment belong to the family of alpha hydroxy acids (AHA); popular examples include glycolic acid and lactic acid. Chemical peels at dermatology offices are offered in different strengths. The three levels of professional chemical peels are:

Light chemical peel
Medium chemical peel
Deep chemical peel

The stronger the peel, the more skin it removes (and the longer the recovery period will be). However, lighter peels often take multiple treatments to achieve the desired results, and have to be repeated more frequently. Light chemical peels can be done as frequently as once a month, while medium peels can be done every four to six months depending on your skin. Deep peels should only be done once every two to three years, at most, due to their intensity.
At-home chemical peels can be done more frequently, however. While their results may be more superficial than in-office treatments, they can be repeated more frequently. For instance, our Caviar Lime Acid Face Peel, which features 10% glycolic acid, can be used one to two times a week as tolerated. At-home chemical peels like this one are great for removing dry skin patches, evening out skin tone, brightening your complexion, and clearing out clogged pores.

What skin conditions can a chemical face peel treat?
Chemical face peels can treat a variety of skin problems, depending on the ingredients used and their concentration. Your dermatologist may recommend a chemical peel for the following skin conditions:

Fine lines and wrinkles
Superficial scarring
Skin discoloration such as age spots and melasma
Certain types of acne
Clogged pores
Uneven skin tone and texture

Chemical peels typically cannot address severe wrinkles or pigmentation issues or sagging skin. A dermatologist like Dr. Harold Lancer will be able to talk to you about alternative treatments that may be better suited to your concerns.

Recovery from a Chemical Peel
With at-home treatments like our Caviar Lime Acid Face peel, there is little to no downtime. Depending on how sensitive your skin is, you might want to avoid using other powerful, drying ingredients in the same routine, such as retinols. You should also wear sunscreen every single day since chemical peels make your skin more sensitive to the sun.
Recovery time is usually 1-7 days for a superficial peel, 7-14 days for a medium peel, and 14-21 days for a deep peel. After an in-office peel, your skin will be red, dry, irritated, and possibly swollen. You can use ice packs and over-the-counter pain-relieving medications to manage any pain and swelling. Treated skin might blister, form a crust, or change in color as the healing process moves forward. You will need to avoid sun exposure for weeks or even months while you wait for your skin to heal.

Choosing Between At-Home and Professional Chemical Peels
In-office chemical peels will deliver a more powerful treatment, but they are also more expensive and require a longer recovery time period than at-home chemical peels. If you are looking to get started with chemical peels, an at-home treatment can be a more affordable and accessible introduction to the world of chemical exfoliation. If your face tolerates the AHAs well and you want to upgrade to a more powerful treatment, then you can seek out a dermatology office like Dr. Harold Lancer’s for a professional chemical peel.

Tired of dry, dull skin that’s covered in flaky patches? Want to achieve a smooth, glowing complexion? Proper hydration is key to plum, youthful-looking skin. In this guide, we’ll cover nine essential tips on how to hydrate your skin no matter the season.
Choose a gentle cleanser.
Cleansing can be one of the most stripping parts of your 3-step skincare routine. If you’ve been using a gel or foaming cleanser, that could be contributing to your dry skin. Instead, switch to a gentle cream or milk cleanser that will remove residue without stripping your skin. If you wear cosmetics, be sure to use a gentle makeup remover as well, such as cleansing balm.
Use a hydrating serum.
Hydrating serums have a thicker texture than toners, making them more moisturizing. Look for a serum that contains hydrating ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, glycerin, ceramides, and peptides. For a selection of Lancer Skincare’s hydrating serums, check out our page of skincare products for dry sensitive skin.

Apply a moisturizer frequently.
Even if you have oily skin, you should still be applying a moisturizer every time you wash or rinse your face — and you should definitely be using an anti-aging moisturizer if you struggle with dry skin. Moisturizers strengthen your skin barrier and help to prevent moisture loss by forming a protective layer on your skin. Look for ingredients such as urea, panthenol, and petrolatum that will help to keep your skin moisturized.
Stock Up on Sunscreen!
Wear sunscreen every day.
Sun exposure will dry out your skin and accelerate the signs of visible aging. To help prevent this, wear quality sunscreen every day with a protection of at least SPF 30. When going outside, protect your face with a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses. Seek out shade and try to avoid being in direct sunlight, especially when the sun is brightest between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. every day.
Consider using a facial oil.
If you have very dry skin, then you might want to consider using a facial oil at night. The facial oil can be applied directly on top of your moisturizer to form an occlusive barrier. You can also mix a couple of drops into your moisturizer before applying it if you prefer not to apply a layer of oil over your face. It’s best to do this at night only since a facial oil might cause your sunscreen to break down.

Get a humidifier.
If you live in a dry climate, the lack of humidity in the air can cause the environment to pull moisture out of your skin. You might benefit from getting a humidifier for your bedroom and running it at night to put some moisture back in the air. If you live somewhere very dry, you might also need to get one for your office that you can run during the daytime too. For more reasons that might explain “Why is my skin so dry even when I moisturize?” check out our blog post on this very subject.
Drink enough water.
If your skin is dry, you need to make sure that you’re hydrating it from the inside out as well as the outside in. To that end, you might want to consider tracking how much water you’re drinking each day. If you don’t like the taste of plain water, try drinking herbal tea or infusing it with fruits and vegetables to give it flavor. Watch out for caffeine and alcohol, which can have a dehydrating effect on your body.
Take short, lukewarm showers.
We love a long, hot shower as much as the next person, but unfortunately that is very dehydrating for your skin. Instead, turn the water to a lukewarm temperature and try to keep your showers as short as possible. Also try to avoid soaking in baths for long periods of time, which will dry out your skin further.
At Lancer Skincare, we offer a wide range of products to help keep skin hydrated, including gentle cleansers, moisturizers, serums, and sunscreens. All of our products come with a 30-day money-back guarantee and all orders ship for free within the U.S., no order minimum needed.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/how-to-soothe-irritated-skin-around-my-eyes/,"By Alona Siniehina / Shutterstock.com
The skin around our eyes is very sensitive, and it’s very vulnerable to becoming itchy, red, and irritated — sometimes without cause, seemingly. If you are struggling with swelling, itchiness, and inflammation, here are eight things that you can do to soothe irritated skin around your eyes:
Wash the eye area.
To start, remove any contacts you are wearing and gently remove any sunscreen or cosmetic products using a makeup remover. Be careful not to rub or tug on the skin around the eye area too hard since it is already delicate and irritated. Follow it up with a gentle milk or cream cleanser to remove any last traces of potential irritants. Keep your eyes closed during this whole process so you do not get product in your eyes!
Apply a soothing eye serum.
Once your skin is clean, you want to apply skincare products for red irritated skin, ideally an eye cream that has specifically been formulated for the delicate eye area. Take a tiny amount of product and gently rub or pat it around your eyes using your fingertips, being careful not to get it into the eye itself. Ensure that all product is absorbed before moving on with the rest of your skincare routine.
Avoid potential irritants.
When you are experiencing irritated skin around your eyes, it’s important to avoid things that could potentially make it worse. This means avoiding the use of eye makeup, including eye liner, eye shadow, and mascara. If you wear contacts, consider switching to glasses for at least a few days to see if that helps your symptoms. And if you wear a chemical sunscreen, then you might want to switch to a mineral one. Chemical UV filters are more pleasant to wear, but they are known to irritate the eye area in some people.
Protect against sun exposure.
Speaking of sunscreen, you need to be extra vigilant about protecting irritated skin against sun exposure. Wear a quality anti aging sunscreen with protection of at least SPF 30 and, ideally, higher. Reapply it every two hours, especially when you are outside, in the water, and/or sweating. Seek shade when possible and wear a wide-brimmed sun hat to protect your face even more. You should also wear large polarized sunglasses to protect your eyes and reduce the strain caused by the glare.

Use Our 3-Step Skincare Method
Try cold or warm compresses.
Laying washcloths soaked in hot or cold water over your irritated eyes may be helpful for soothing them. Cold compresses are effective for swelling, which is why they’re also one of our favorite treatments for how to get rid of puffy eyes fast. Meanwhile, warm compresses are soothing for achy, tired eyes that are dried out or crusty. Some people also like to alternate between the two so they get the benefits of both hot and cold therapy.
Use a humidifier for dry skin.
If you live in a dry climate, the lack of humidity in the air might be contributing to the irritation around your eyes. Humidifiers are helpful for treating this because they put moisture back into the air, soothing your skin without even touching it. Try getting a small humidifier for your bedroom and running it while you sleep to see if that soothes your skin.

Treat underlying causes.
There are many potential underlying causes of irritated skin around your eyes, including allergies, eczema, and dermatitis. In these cases, it is important to treat the underlying causes; otherwise, symptoms such as irritated skin will continue to occur. If removing potential irritants from your cosmetic routine hasn’t alleviated the irritation, start exploring other possible causes that might be the true culprit behind your irritated eyes.
See a doctor if necessary.
If you suspect that the irritated skin around your eyes is due to an underlying medical issue, then you might need to see a doctor ro resolve it, such as as your primary care physician, a dermatologist, or an optician. If you’re not sure exactly what the issue is, schedule an appointment with your primary care physician, and they can refer you to the appropriate doctor.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/the-ultimate-summer-skincare-checklist/,"By Estrada Anton / Shutterstock.com
Skincare routines should be updated seasonally, and summer is no exception. With warmer weather already arriving, here are nine action items that you should have on your summer skincare checklist this year:
Use SPF regularly.
Wearing SPF every day is important no matter the season, but it’s especially critical during summer when daylight hours are longer. Choose anti-aging sunscreen with protection of at least SPF 30 and apply it to all exposed skin. When you are outside, apply sunscreen every two hours, especially if you are sweating or getting in and out of the water.
Seek out shade.
Beyond just applying sunscreen, you should also try to limit your sun exposure by seeking out shade whenever you are outside. Protect your skin with a wide-brimmed hat, as well as sunglasses, to slow down signs of premature aging such as wrinkles and fine lines! Try to avoid being in the sun between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. when the rays are the strongest.
Tan the safe way.
If you love a bronze glow during the summer, with your skin frying while lying out in the sun or getting in a tanning bed, both methods expose your skin to UV radiation, and not even skincare for wrinkles can reverse all the effects. Instead, get a glow with tanning products that contain DHA, either at a spray tan salon or by using self-tanning products at home. You’ll get a totally safe glow in just a matter of hours, with no accidental sunburn or weird tan lines resulting.

Lighten up your skincare routine.
Now that winter is over, it’s time to say goodbye to thick serums and heavy creams. Instead, focus on lightweight skincare products that will still deliver the benefits you need. Also look for products that offer multiple benefits so that you don’t have to layer on multiple products to get the same effects.

Prioritize antioxidants.
Antioxidants help protect your skin from free radical damage caused by things like dirt and pollution. Since most people spend more time outside during the summer, it’s important to make sure that you are incorporating antioxidants into your anti-aging skincare routine. Try applying a vitamin C product like our Vitamin C Radiance treatment in the morning to protect your skin all day long.
Exfoliate the right amount.
Most people’s faces produce more oil in the summertime, which means that they can exfoliate more often than in the winter. However, it’s important not to go overboard and over-exfoliate your face in an effort to control the oil. This can damage the skin barrier and lead to more problems down the road. Instead, exfoliate with a quality polish a few times a week to keep your skin looking smooth yet nourished.

By Ground Picture / Shutterstock.com
Don’t stop moisturizing.
Many people are tempted to skip moisturizer during hot summer days. While we understand the inclination, this can upset the balance of your skin and hurt it in the long run. Instead of skipping your moisturizer altogether, choose a lightweight water or gel cream that will absorb instantly instead of sitting on your face. If you have dry skin, use a lightweight moisturizer during the day and a heavyweight moisturizer at night so that you don’t feel sticky during the day.
Redo your makeup routine.
In addition to lightening up your skincare routine, you should also try to pare back on your makeup routine. Summer heat and sweat can cause makeup to slide right off your face, so wearing fewer layers can keep you looking good for longer. For instance, instead of a full coverage foundation, you can try a tinted moisturizer, and you might be able to eliminate certain products such as highlighters altogether.
Keep showers short.
Some people shower more than once during summer to stay feeling fresh, which means that it’s essential to keep those showers as short as possible — no more than five minutes each. You should also turn the temperature down to lukewarm or even cool, since hot water is quite drying for the skin.

Even people with elaborate skincare routines can forget about their lips — but proper lip care is essential to maintain the health and beauty of your lips. The skin on your lips is quite delicate, and it’s exposed to a lot of stressors through eating, drinking and the weather. This is why so many people struggle with chapped, dry and peeling lips, not just during the winter but throughout the year.
Having a lip care routine is essential for creating the best skincare routine overall. Taking good care of your lips will help to keep them soft, plump and hydrated. It will also help to protect your lips from getting dry and chapped, which can compromise your skin and lead to cracks and scabs. By following a preventative lip care routine, you won’t suddenly find yourself scrambling to heal your cracked lips before a big event. Instead, you’ll enjoy having happy and healthy lips year-round. Here are the steps that you should follow to create a lip care routine!

How to Create a Lip Care Routine
For starters, you should be cleaning your lips every time you wash your face. If you wear cosmetics products like lipstick or lip gloss, then apply your makeup remover to your lips as well as the rest of your face. Follow it up with a gentle facial cleanser to remove any last traces of dirt and debris. You should apply a lightweight lip balm throughout the day, especially after eating and drinking. This will make a big difference to cracked lips and help prevent your lips from becoming so chapped. 
Since your lips also need to be protected from the sun, just like the rest of your face, you should choose a daily lip balm that has SPF protection and apply it liberally whenever you are exposed to the sun, just like you would any anti-aging sunscreen. You should also wear a lip mask at night to prevent moisture loss and encourage your lips to heal from the stresses of the day. Lip masks are heavier and more nourishing than a typical lip balm, which is why most people wear them only at night.

For added results, you can incorporate a lip serum into your routine such as the Lancer Volume Enhancing Lip Serum. These lip serums are typically designed to have a plumping and smoothing effect, making your lips look more full, minimizing the appearance of fine lines and defining your lip contours. You can use a serum in place of your lip balm or wear it under a lip mask at night if you want to wake up with plump lips. If you get flaky or peeling lips, then they might benefit from some occasional light exfoliation a few times a week. The key here is choosing very gentle exfoliation instead of a harsh scrub or super-strong chemical exfoliator. You can buy one at the beauty store or make your own at home using sugar and honey if you’re in a DIY mood.

Other Lifestyle Tips for Healthy Lips
Beyond just wearing SPF lip balm, you should also protect your face by wearing a broad-brimmed hat that covers the lower half of your face in shadow. Seek shade whenever you are outside and try to avoid the sun when the rays are at their strongest, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. each day. If you are going outside in the winter, use a scarf to cover your mouth to protect your lips from the wind and snow. Using a humidifier when you sleep at night will put water back into the air and soothe all kinds of chapped skin, including your lips.
To hydrate your lips from the inside out, be sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day. After eating food or drinking flavored beverages, you should also wipe your lips clean so that no lingering particles can potentially cause irritation. Try to avoid licking or touching your lips, especially if they are already cracked or scabbed, as this behavior will only aggravate them.

Reasons Why Lip Care Is Essential was last modified:  July 14th, 2023 by [email protected]",Reasons Why Lip Care Is Essential,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Volume-Enhancing-Lip-Serum.jpg
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/dry-vs-dehydrated-skin-what-you-need-to-know/,"By Alona Siniehina / Shutterstock.com
While many people in the skincare world use the words “dry” and “dehydrated” interchangeably, these mean two separate things. We’ll explain the difference between dry and dehydrated skin and explore what skincare for sensitive skin you should use if your face is tight and flaky.
Dry vs. Dehydrated Skin
Dry skin is a skin type that is characterized by a lack of oils and lipids. Having dry skin is largely determined by genetics, but certain environmental factors can also make dry skin worse. For example, cold or dry climates, long hot showers, certain skincare products, some medical treatments, and the natural aging process can all lead to dry skin.
Dehydrated skin is a skin condition that anyone can get. Dry skin is characterized by a lack of water in the top layer of the skin. Dehydrated skin can be caused by many different factors, including not drinking enough water, a damaged skin barrier, and extreme weather conditions.
While dehydrated skin can happen to anyone, people with dry skin are more likely to have dehydrated skin. This is because the natural oils in our skin help to prevent water loss. If you don’t have enough oils to form that natural barrier, then water can evaporate more easily from the top layer of your skin.
The symptoms of dry vs. dehydrated skin can sometimes be very similar. The skin will often feel tight, rough, and/or itchy especially after cleansing. You may notice dull or flaky patches on your skin, and your skin might scale or peel off. You might also notice more prominent fine lines and wrinkles, as well as under eye bags. Dehydrated skin also lacks elasticity and won’t spring back as quickly as normal. For more information, see our ultimate guide that explains “Why is my skin so dry even when I moisturize?”
Find Out What Skincare Method Is Best for You

How to Treat Dry and Dehydrated Skin
Got either dry or dehydrated skin (or both)? Here are six tips to help you find relief:
Choose the right ingredients.
If you are struggling with dry skin, then you will want to reinforce your natural lipid barrier by looking out for ingredients such as shea butter, coconut oil, squalene oil, mineral oil, lanolin, and other oils. If you are struggling with dehydrated skin, look for ingredients that will pull moisture into your skin, such as glycerin, aloe, honey, and snail mucin. Certain ingredients, such as hyaluronic acid and ceramides, are beneficial for both dehydrated and dry skin.
Seek out skincare for sensitive skin.
In addition to seeking out specific ingredients, you might also want to prioritize skincare kits for sensitive skin. Dry, dehydrated skin is prone to irritation, and choosing skin care for sensitive skin will help to nourish it while you work on restoring your skin barrier.
Get a gentle cleanser.
Cleansing can be one of the most drying, stripping steps of your skincare routine. Instead of a foaming or gel cleanser — which can be rather harsh — choose a gentle milk or cream face wash that will cleanse your skin without making it feel dry and tight. Massage the cleanser into your face for no more than 60 seconds, and then rinse it off with lukewarm water.

Take shorter showers.
We love a long, hot shower as much as the next person, but unfortunately all that water exposure will dry your skin right out. Try to limit your showers to 5-10 minutes, and avoid soaking in the bath for long periods of time. Also keep the temperature set to lukewarm or even cool; hot water will dry your skin out faster than cool water.
Drink enough water.
As you hydrate your face from the outside in, you also need to make sure that you are hydrating from the inside out as well. Make sure that you are drinking enough fluids each day, and try to limit your consumption of dehydrating beverages such as caffeine and alcohol. Instead, try infused water and caffeine-free herbal tea to stay hydrated throughout the day.
Try a humidifier.
If you live in a dry climate, the lack of moisture in the air could definitely be making your skin dry or dehydrated. Buy a humidifier and run it at night while you sleep to put some moisture back in the air and alleviate your dehydrated skin.

This award-winning, at-home face peel features Caviar Lime Extract, Retinol, 10% Phytic Acid, 10% Glycolic Acid, Pineapple and Papaya enzymes….and that’s just to name a few of the key ingredients that target mature skin concerns without the stressing telltale signs that some chemical exfoliants can leave behind. The result is a brighter complexion along with soft, smooth and supple skin.
To use this at-home chemical peel, first start by cleansing the skin with Dr. Lancer’s The Method: Cleanse. (Pro Tip: you’ll want to skip your polish step on this day since your Caviar Peel application will be the exfoliant in your skincare routine.) By thoroughly removing any makeup, dirt and debris first from the skin you ensure that it is ready to be treated and that there are no barriers such as makeup that inhibit the peel from penetrating the skin deeper, faster and evenly. Next, apply a generous amount to dry skin avoiding the eye area, lips and broken skin.

Leave on for 10-15 minutes. You may experience a slight tingle as the product starts to work but it should subside quickly! Remember this is an active chemical peel with potent ingredients to reduce fine lines, smooth texture, or help fade dark spots so a tingling feeling lets you know it is working. Follow up by rinsing thoroughly and patting the skin dry. Use can use 1 to 2 times weekly as tolerated. Caviar Lime Acid Peel is suitable for anyone showing signs of mature skin and aging and can even be used for those in their teens who are experiencing breakouts and post acne marks. Caviar Lime Acid peel is a great at-home peel for every skin type.

If you don’t currently have a nighttime skincare routine, you’re really missing out. Nighttime skincare routines don’t just cleanse your face after a long day — they’re the perfect opportunity to use powerful skincare products. In this guide, we discuss the benefits of a nighttime skincare routine and explain what 3-step skincare routine you should be following at night.
Benefits of a Nighttime Skincare Routine
First of all, a nighttime skincare routine ensures that your face is clean and fresh for a full night of sleep. A double cleanse will remove makeup, sunscreen and other cosmetic products that can block your pores or transfer to your pillow while you sleep. It will also remove dirt, sweat, pollutants, debris and other potential irritants that can dull your complexion or cause blemishes.
Nighttime is also the best time of day to use certain powerhouse actives like exfoliants and retinol. These ingredients can make your face more sensitive to the sun, which is why it’s a good idea to use them at night, before you go to bed. That way you can let these products get to work while you sleep in a cool, dark room, so you don’t have to worry about sun exposure. Then you can wash them off in the morning and go about your day with a newly glowing complexion.
Your cells also repair and multiply at night while you sleep, which is another compelling reason to have a nighttime skincare routine. If you want to take advantage of that, then applying skincare products before you go to sleep will help to supercharge your results, support overall skin health and address pigmentation issues such as white sun spots on the skin.
Having a nighttime skincare routine is also key for keeping your face hydrated and moisturized. Your oil levels peak at midday and drop off during the night while you sleep. If you don’t have a nighttime skincare routine or skip applying a moisturizer before you go to bed, then you will probably wake up to a dry, dull complexion.

Steps of a Nighttime Skincare Routine
Ready to put together a nighttime skincare routine? Here are the steps you should consider incorporating:
Makeup remover
If you wear cosmetics or waterproof sunscreen, then remove that first with a makeup remover or makeup wipes. This ensures that you have a cleaner canvas to work with and that your other skincare products can get into the skin.
Exfoliate
The first step of the Lancer Method 3-step skincare routine, exfoliating prepares your skin for cleansing and helps smooth out your complexion. We recommend using our exfoliating scrubs after removing your makeup but before cleansing your face for optimal results.
Cleanser
Next, use a cleaner to remove any remaining sweat, dirt and debris from your face. Massage the cleanser all over your damp face for about 60 seconds, being careful to keep your eyes closed so that you don’t get any product in them. Rinse your face off with lukewarm water and careful pat dry.
Mask
Masks are optional, but they can elevate your skin routine. Most of our masks are designed to be applied after cleansing your face, and then washed off after 10-15 minutes. Choose a mask based on whatever you feel your skin needs that day, whether it is hydrating or brightening.

Serum
Serums are the most powerful and effective products in any skincare routine. While we don’t include them as part of the base 3-step Lancer Method skincare routine, we highly recommend adding one to your nighttime routine to get the benefit we talked about in the previous section. Grab one of our night treatments for the face to start seeing a difference in your skin!
Moisturizer
A moisturizer is the last step of a 3-step skincare routine, and they are essential for slowing moisture while you sleep. We recommend choosing a thicker moisturizer than you wear during the daytime since oil production slows down at night.
Eye cream
Eye creams are also optional, but they really do benefit the delicate skin around your eye area. Look for a thick, hydrating eye cream that will provide the moisture that you need to soothe eye bags and creases while you sleep.
If you’re ready to start realizing the benefits of a nighttime skincare routine, grab one of the Lancer Method skincare travel kits! These kits provide a convenient way to try out a curated nighttime skincare routine. We also offer value kits of the full-size products if you’re ready to commit.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/treat-white-spots-skin/,"White spots on the skin occur when the production of skin pigment (a.k.a. melanin) is interrupted. This hypopigmentation disorder may be simply cosmetic, or it may be a sign of underlying health issues. In most cases, white spots on the skin are not a cause for concern, and they often clear up on their own within a few weeks. However, you might still want to get the white spots checked by your dermatologist just in case, especially if they persist for more than a couple of weeks.If you already have stubborn white spots that won’t go away, you may be wondering what to do about them even if they are benign. Many people don’t like the appearance of white spots on their skin, especially if the spots are very large or located in a prominent area. In this guide, we will explain common causes of white spots on the skin, how to prevent white spots from forming, and skincare treatment options for white spots on the skin.
Causes of White Spots on the Skin
There are multiple common causes of white spots on the skin, and each skin disorder requires a different treatment. It’s important to visit a dermatology office to get an office diagnosis and go over your treatment options so that you know exactly what you’re dealing with. There are six main causes of white spots on the skin to be familiar with:
1. Sunspots or guttate hypomelanosis
White spots can begin to appear on your skin after years in the sun without adequate protection. These spots — called idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis (IGH) — are generally relatively small, between 1-3mm. They aren’t itchy, raised, or painful, but some people find them unsightly, especially if they provide a stark contrast to their natural skin tone. Most treatments are cosmetic and focused on improving the appearance of the spots (more on this in the next section).
2. Tinea versicolor or pityriasis versicolor
Tinea versicolor occurs when a fungus living on the surface of the skin grows out of control. The fungal infection causes dry, itchy, scaly patches that may be either lighter or darker than the surrounding skin. Doctors will typically suggest applying over-the-counter antifungal shampoos, washes, soaps, and creams to the affected areas first. They may later prescribe antifungal pills for a short time if topical treatments have no effect.

3. Pityriasis alba
Pityriasis alba is a skin condition that causes red, scaly, itchy patches that leave behind faint white areas of skin once they heal. The condition is most common in children between the ages of 3-16 and maybe a mild form of atopic dermatitis. Symptoms often resolve on their own, but the healing process can be sped up by the application of moisturizers to soothe dry skin. Your doctor may also recommend the use of topical corticosteroid creams or nonsteroidal elidel cream.
4. Vitiligo
Vitiligo is a skin condition where large white patches of skin appear in areas where melanocytes (pigment-producing cells) have been destroyed. The cause is not known, but it may be an autoimmune disease related to immune system dysfunction. Possible treatments for vitiligo include:

Steroid creams
Elidel cream
Ultraviolet light therapy
Bleaching darker skin
Tattooing the white patches
Surgery to remove the upper portions of the affected skin

5. Milia
Milia are firm, painless sacs filled with white fluid that develop on the surface of the skin. Primary milia occurs when keratin becomes trapped under the skin and forms the sac. Secondary milia develops as the result of skin trauma, such as blistering, sunburn, dermabrasion, and other forms of tissue damage. Retinoid topical creams are usually the first recommended course of treatment, followed by topical steroids.
6. Eczema
Eczema is an inflammatory skin condition that causes itchiness, dry skin, rashes, scaly patches, blisters, and skin infections. During an eczema flare-up, the affected patches of skin may appear paler than the rest of the body, especially on darker skin. There are seven different types of eczema to know:

Atopic dermatitis
Contact dermatitis
Dyshidrotic eczema
Nummular eczema
Seborrheic dermatitis
Stasis dermatitis

Using gentle cleansers instead of harsh soaps and limiting your bath or shower time will help to calm down eczema flare-ups. The skin should be kept moisturized with an unscented lotion. The use of anti-itch creams will help to reduce symptoms and also discourage scratching (which will further inflame the skin). Taking an oral allergy medication such as anti-histamine may also help to reduce the inflammation. If these at-home remedies don’t control your eczema, then your doctor might recommend a  topical corticosteroid or another prescription treatment.

Steps for Prevention of White Spots on Skin
Even if you’ve already developed idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis on your skin, protecting your skin from further sun damage is vital. A chic sunhat is a fashionable solution for keeping the sun off your face and shoulders, but it’s no replacement for sunscreen. A sunscreen that prevents further damage while also treating your skin is worth its weight in gold.
Wearing sunscreen with a minimum protection of SPF 30 is essential; in fact, there is relatively no difference in how much sun protection you receive between a sunscreen with SPF 30 and one with a higher SPF. The Sheer Fluid Sun Shield Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen from Lancer Skincare is the ideal sunscreen for protecting your skin while also providing anti-aging benefits.
This weightless broad-spectrum sunscreen protects skin from harmful UV rays and treats it with plant extracts and plant-derived stem cells to improve your skin’s radiance and reduce the appearance of current sun damage. Even better, it works as a primer, allowing your makeup to glide on without the greasy finish of most sunscreens. You should apply sunscreen to all areas of exposed skin, even when sitting indoors, in order to prevent the IHG from getting worse.
Treatments for White Spots on Skin
Now that you know how to guard your skin from additional UV damage, it’s time to treat the appearance of the idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis already present on your skin. Though you can treat brown spots with anti-aging creams and antioxidants, white spots are different. White spots are an absence of pigment, and it’s rarely possible to make the pigment return to your skin. 

You may not be able to reverse the loss of pigment in your skin, but you can treat the spots by evening the overall appearance of your skin, which makes spots less evident. Besides professional dermatology treatments, some skincare products for white spots that you can try at home include:
Sunscreen for White Spots
You can also prevent the white spots from expanding by protecting your skin with an anti-aging sunscreen at all times. In addition to keeping your existing white spots from growing and reducing the contrast between the white spots and your regular skin tone, sunscreen prevents further damage to your skin and helps stop additional white spots from developing. 
Exfoliation for White Spots
When you look for skincare that will provide you with a brightened, more even-looking skin tone, look for exfoliating products with active ingredients that polish (our way of saying exfoliate since this process should also be gentle on your skin) damaged skin to reveal fresher, younger-looking skin.
A cream with glycolic acid, like Dr. Lancer’s Retexturizing Treatment, can help reduce the appearance of discoloration and give your skin a smoother appearance. The 10% glycolic acid exfoliates skin to reveal glowing, younger-looking skin and a more even skin tone, counteracting the aging effect of sun-damaged skin. 
Because glycolic acid is a powerful Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA), this treatment also includes antioxidants and humectants to improve your skin’s hydration and lock in necessary moisture to maintain your bright, radiant look. When using an AHA, be extra vigilant about applying sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, and wearing a sunhat, as your skin will be more sensitive to the sun.

Vitamin C for White Spots
Vitamin C is also a popular antioxidant for providing a brightened tone and addressing hyperpigmentation. While Vitamin C won’t eliminate your white spots, it will even out your overall tone and help lessen the darker spots surrounding the white spots, helping them appear less noticeable. 
Advanced C Radiance Treatment Cream is a powerful combination of 10% Vitamin C and retinol. Retinol helps exfoliate damaged, discolored skin, while Vitamin C reduces the appearance of hyperpigmentation for even skin. The combination of these two ingredients boosts skin cell regeneration and reduces the appearance of sun damage, while rich shea butter soothes skin with luxurious moisture for refreshed, younger-looking skin. White spots will be less conspicuous, and your skin will appear brightened and renewed.

Self-tanner for White Spots
You can also try topical treatments to hide the differentiation in pigment using a self-tanner. If you’d like to try it on your own, you can carefully apply a self-tanner directly to the white spot. Use a small concealer brush or cotton swab to apply the self-tanner to the white spot itself, being meticulous about avoiding the darker skin surrounding it. Give it a chance to develop before deciding if you need another application. Though it may not be an exact match, tanning the affected area may make the spot blend in just enough with the rest of your skin to make it less obvious. 
Dermatology Treatments for White Spots
If you’ve used skincare with powerful antioxidants and AHAs for brighter, more even-looking skin, but you still wish to pursue further treatments, there are other options. An experienced dermatologist, like Dr. Harold Lancer, can assess your skin properly and proceed with treatments ideal for your skin.

Since you generally cannot correct the loss of pigment that causes white spots, you must instead treat the skin surrounding the spots. IPL — or Intense Pulsed Light — can be used to target and treat sun-damaged skin. This works by fading the darker skin surrounding the white spots, allowing the spots to blend in better with the rest of your skin. 
Another topical treatment is a medication called tacrolimus, an ointment normally used for eczema. This prescription treatment is not to be taken lightly since it’s an immunosuppressant. Still, it was shown to improve the appearance of IGH white spots in 11% of patients in a double-blind study. If you’ve tried other methods and want to pursue this treatment, see your dermatologist. 
Regardless of how you choose to treat your white spots, experts agree that sunscreen is the number one choice for preventing IGH and minimizing the appearance and growth of white spots on the skin. Sun damage can have lasting effects, but it is possible to treat and prevent further damage with the right sunscreen and high-quality skincare products.
Conclusion
There are multiple causes of white spots on the skin, including sun spots, tinea versicolor, pityriasis alba, vitiligo, milia, and eczema. Preventive steps, such as wearing sunscreen every day, are key to preventing white spots from forming on the skin. If you already have white spots, you might not be able to restore pigment to those areas, but you can even out your skin tone by using products such as glycolic acid, vitamin C, and self-tanner.

How to Treat White Spots on Skin was last modified:  September 21st, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer",How to Treat White Spots on Skin,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/white-spots-on-the-skin-causes.jpg
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/product-launch-younger-revealing-mask-intense/,"Nothing defines an indulgent day of pampering quite like a face mask. Up until recently, face masks were incredibly messy and required quite a bit of time and planning for the full process. They also necessitated privacy to wash your face first, apply the mask, and then wash it completely off. Recently, however, masks have been transformed, and Lancer Skincare has been at the forefront of this modernization in skincare. First, Dr. Harold Lancer created the incredible Lift and Plump Sheet Mask, and now comes the latest in cutting-edge skincare science.

Welcome to the newest innovation in face masks. Dr. Lancer has created the new Younger Revealing Mask Intense, a luxurious state-of-the-art mask featuring a silicone encapsulated mineral powder, which allows the mask to be removed with a magnetic removal tool. This revolutionary mask combines an exclusive anti-aging retinoid formula designed to promote the look of renewed, radiant skin. Hydroxypinacolone retinoate improves the look of your skin’s surface texture, while dimethicone provides emollience to soften and hydrate your skin. The iron-rich mineral powder allows the mask to be removed with the swipe of a magnetic removal tool, leaving your skin feeling supple, refreshed, and looking firmer.
The unique retinoid contained in this mask allows you to receive the benefits of a prescription retinol—including minimizing the appearance of lines and wrinkles—without the drawbacks of thinning skin that are sometimes associated with the prescription. Because of the combination of retinoids in the formula and the microcurrent stimulation provided by the use of the magnetic removal tool on the mineral-rich mask, Younger Revealing Mask Intense nourishes and tones your skin. The result is that your wrinkles look less numerous, less deep, and you’re left with a younger-looking, smoother complexion that glows.
This next-generation treatment mask is not only effective for improving the look and feel of your skin, but it is profoundly satisfying and easy to use, leaving no mess behind. Simply apply a thin, even layer to clean skin and after 5-10 minutes, hover the removal tool over the skin to lift the mask off. The magnetic removal tool removes all visible traces of the mask, so you can remove this mask almost anywhere, from the back of a cab to your desk at work. Meanwhile, the anti-aging ingredients in the formula are left behind even after removal of the mineral component, so these beneficial agents can continue treating the skin. Pat the remaining product into the skin without rinsing for a glowing, youthful appearance. Follow with The Method: Nourish and go about your day with skin that looks beautiful and renewed.
Treatment masks are new again. Younger Revealing Mask Intense helps your skin look its best with a unique delivery and removal system that provides a visibly younger-looking complexion, without the fuss of old-fashioned masks. Use this mask anytime, anywhere for softer, smoother, radiant-looking skin. Your skin will look new again, too.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/get-rid-stretch-marks/,"Pregnant women carefully coat their growing bellies in cream after cream, hoping to avoid those angry red marks left when the skin on their bellies stretches too fast. But pregnant women aren’t the only people struck by these marks. Regardless of gender or age, these unsightly marks can appear on anyone’s skin.

How Do You End up With Stretch Marks?
Stretch marks—the dreaded result of skin that has been stretched quickly and for an extended period of time—are an infuriating skin concern for anyone who has become pregnant, gained or lost a significant amount of weight, or experienced rapid growth during puberty. The stretch mark is the result of the collagen and elastin bands within the skin rupturing or being broken down by the rapid or intense stretching of the skin. The elastin and collagen fibers break, causing a scar that forms from the inside of the skin. These marks usually start out red, brown, black, or purplish in color, but will eventually fade to a silvery grey or white with a slight indentation and differing texture. 
Stretch marks are extremely common—especially in pregnant women—and are exasperatingly difficult to prevent and treat. Your likelihood to develop stretch marks is genetic, and you cannot control what you do and do not inherit. Thankfully, there are things you can do to help treat stretch marks, even after they’ve reared their unpleasant heads.
Knowing What Works and What Doesn’t
First and foremost, be wary of any cream or ointment claiming to heal stretch marks. While keeping skin moisturized and supple may be helpful in preventing stretch marks, there is no definitive research showing a significant benefit. Additionally, a moisturizer is not able to reach below the surface of the skin to eliminate scarring and heal broken collagen and elastic fibers. Once the stretch marks have appeared, a topical treatment cannot reverse the damage. Even topical treatments containing collagen and elastin cannot repair the damaged bands that caused the stretch mark scar in the first place. 
However, a treatment containing glycolic acid, like The Method: Body Nourish, can help minimize the appearance of the stretch mark scars. The 10% glycolic acid combined with Hylaplex®, a powerful moisturizing compound with lasting benefits, help keep the skin plump while exfoliating for smoother, softer skin. If your stretch marks are still red or purple, the glycolic acid may also help brighten any discoloration. When glycolic acid is used in combination with Vitamin C, the brightening effect on the discoloration is even more significant. Advanced C Radiance Treatment contains a powerful 10% stabilized Vitamin C to help fade darker stretch marks. The retinol in the formula also helps improve the appearance of stretch marks when applied once to twice daily to help minimize the appearance of your stretch marks and make them less noticeable over time. 
Though it may sound like there’s little to be done, there are some medical options that may help improve your stretch marks. Before signing up for any of these treatments, you’ll need to seek the advice of an experienced dermatologist who will be able to tell you which treatment is right for you and your stretch marks. 
The least invasive option is a topical retinoid called tretinoin, found in products like Retin-A, Renova, and Avita. These retinoids are derived Vitamin A and have been proven to help improve the appearance of stretch marks that are relatively new—less than a few months old. When it works effectively, tretinoin helps your stretch marks look more like the rest of your skin. Improvement is usually around 20%, which may be significant enough for many clients—especially those who want to avoid medical procedures. 
Advanced Treatments for Stretch Marks
However, for those who are willing to pursue more aggressive treatments, chemical peels, microdermabrasion, and light or laser treatments have all been shown to improve the appearance of stretch marks. Again, your dermatologist can best determine which treatment is ideal for your skin.
A series of 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) chemical peels can help improve the appearance of stretch marks because these peels penetrate much deeper than Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA) or Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA) peels. However, if you’re looking for dramatic results, a chemical peel isn’t likely to provide the improvement you’re looking for. 
Dermabrasion is another option for treating the appearance of stretch marks. This procedure resurfaces the skin by removing the top layer of skin, encouraging the growth of new, smoother skin. Though dermabrasion will not treat the actual stretch marks themselves, it can make them less noticeable. Once again, however, this procedure won’t provide dramatic improvement. 
For substantial improvement, your best option for treating stretch marks is a laser or light therapy like Intense Pulsed Light (IPL), Pulsed Dye Laser (PDL), or Fractional Photothermolysis (FP). These laser treatments repair the skin and regenerate skin cells, causing improved skin elasticity and reducing the appearance of the stretch marks. Some laser treatments also shrink dilated blood vessels, helping resolve the discoloration present in newer stretch marks. Studies have consistently shown that laser treatments are the most likely treatment to provide significant, lasting improvement to your stretch marks. 
While there are multitudes of products out there that claim to prevent stretch marks, there’s really nothing you can do to keep stretch marks from forming on your skin when it stretches quickly or significantly. As frustrating as that is, once they appear, they can be treated. Regardless of what treatment you choose, begin an over-the-counter treatment as soon as you notice stretch marks on your body. Then, schedule an appointment with your dermatologist to ascertain what kind of additional treatment is likely to be most effective for your stretch marks. You may not be able to change your genetics and stop stretch marks from appearing, but you can improve their appearance with the right treatments.

How to Get Rid of Stretch Marks was last modified:  March 4th, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer",How to Get Rid of Stretch Marks,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/how-to-get-rid-of-stretch-marks-lancer-skincare.jpg
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/get-rid-blackheads/,"Blackheads are among the more frustrating types of breakouts because they are notoriously difficult to treat. However, with the proper understanding of what blackheads are and what kind of skincare can help treat them, it is possible to improve and eliminate blackheads for radiant, healthy-looking skin. 

It is important to understand that blackheads are not a result of dirty skin or poor hygiene. Blackheads occur when dead skin and oil become trapped deep in your pores. The built-up skin and excess oil then oxidize where the surface meets the air, creating the black dot you see in your skin. Because blackheads are not caused by bacteria, as other pimples are, they will not respond to topical treatments meant to disinfect, like benzoyl peroxide or sulfur. Luckily, there are ways to treat blackheads to improve the look of your skin. 
The 3-Step Approach to Blackheads
First, it is important to make sure you aren’t over-drying or irritating your skin in an attempt to rid your face of blackheads. Blackheads are too far beneath the surface of your skin to be scrubbed away, so any exfoliation should be gentle, which is why we encourage finding an exfoliant that acts more like a polish in terms of treating the surface of the skin gently, like polishing a piece of silver until it shines with its own natural radiance. The Method: Polish Blemish Control uses pumpkin and pomegranate enzymes and uniform quartz and sodium bicarbonate crystals to gently remove dead skin cells, while salicylic acid and lilac stem cell compound work below the surface of the skin to help keep the pores free of dead skin and excess oil. 
Once you’ve polished your skin to remove dead, pore-clogging skin, follow with a cleanser that is gentle enough not to be too drying, but still helps keep pores clear and clean to avoid additional blackheads. Avoid anything overly creamy, as the emollients in cream cleansers can contribute to clogged pores. The Method: Cleanse Blemish Control is a gel cleanser with natural exfoliants like salicylic acid and tea tree oil to help remove dead skin cells and maintain clear pores. This cleanser utilizes lilac stem cell compound to help absorb oil and keep sebum from congesting your pores. Keep in mind that skincare products with Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA) exfoliants—like the salicylic acid found in this cleanser—are particularly effective for treating blackheads as they help to minimize pores and exfoliate the build-up of oil and dead skin that causes blackheads. 
After you’ve found a way to polish and cleanse your skin without dehydrating or irritating it, which would cause excess production of oil, you’ll need a moisturizer that provides your skin with vital moisture without further clogging your pores. Look for a gel moisturizer or a light moisturizer, as these kinds of moisturizing lotions typically do not include the creamy emollients that can become greasy and contribute to clogged pores. The Method: Nourish Blemish Control is an extra-light formula created to moisturize the skin with nasturtium flower extract while regulating sebum and absorbing oil with salicylic acid and lilac stem cells. Additionally, rare grape polyphenol õ-viniferin—a potent antioxidant—helps protect the skin from impurities and provides anti-aging benefits.  
So, now that you know how to treat your existing blackheads, how can you keep your skin from developing even more blackheads? The continuous use of BHA products, like The Method: 3-Step Blemish Control, will help to exfoliate your skin, keeping pores clear. You can also use products like clay or charcoal masks and oil-blotting papers to help control oil, absorb excess oil, and keep it from clogging your pores. However, if this does not seem to be sufficient to eliminate current blackheads or keep additional blackheads from forming, you may need to see your dermatologist to discuss additional treatments. 
Advanced Blackhead Treatments
If over-the-counter BHA treatment is insufficient, you can try a series of BHA peels for a deeper, more thorough polishing of the skin. If BHA is simply not working for you, another option is to try a treatment containing glycolic acid—an Alpha Hydroxy Acid—for more dramatic exfoliation. Retexturizing Treatment, which uses 10% glycolic acid to chemically polishes dead skin cells to reveal fresher skin. This treatment improves the appearance of pores and discoloration, while also maintaining a balanced moisture level with phospholipid complex. 
Alternately, you can see an experienced dermatologist for blackhead extractions. Do not attempt to extract blackheads yourself, as you may cause scarring or hyperpigmentation. A dermatologist is trained to identify the best method for an extraction, as well as the difference between a blackhead and a sebaceous filament. If you try to remove a sebaceous filament—a hair-like strand that channels the flow of oil within the pore—you can cause infection and it will only return to appearing as a blackhead as it’s a natural part of your pore. Your dermatologist may also be able to direct you to additional treatments—like facials or microdermabrasion—that can help treat your blackheads and keep them from coming back.
Once you’ve treated your blackheads, you’ll want to do everything you can to make sure they don’t return. Continue to use skincare with BHA to encourage proper exfoliation of the skin and maintain clear pores. Be patient and consistent with your skincare and avoid overdoing it with anything—excess cleansing, polishing, and moisturizing can all contribute to increased oil production and clogged pores. Drink plenty of water and maintain a balanced, healthy diet to ensure a healthy body and hydrated skin. This will also help you avoid any skin reactions from food allergies. Wear makeup that is oil-free and marked non-comedogenic, meaning it won’t contribute to excess oil and won’t clog your pores. Avoid oily sunscreens and hair products that may irritate your skin or leave a greasy film on your face. Be extra careful about what touches your face, as a dirty phone, tight hat, or hair with a lot of products can contribute to clogged pores. Finally, do your very best to avoid stress, which can trigger hormone imbalances, increased oil, and acne flare-ups. A stress-free life means stress-free skin, and that’s something we can all enjoy. 
Blackheads can be particularly stubborn and difficult to eliminate, but with proper treatment and continued care, you can clear your clogged pores to reveal clear, glowing skin.

How to Get Rid of Blackheads was last modified:  March 4th, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer",How to Get Rid of Blackheads,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/how-to-get-rid-of-blackheads-lancer-skincare.jpg
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/use-face-mask/,"By now, we’ve all seen someone on social media, in a magazine, or on an airplane with a—let’s be honest here—slightly unnerving-looking sheet mask covering their face. Thankfully, at this point most of us know what we’re looking at. While the look of a sheet mask is a bit Phantom of the Opera, the benefits are well worth the unusual appearance.

Sheet masks have become increasingly popular over the last couple years, and there’s a good reason for that: Sheet masks allow product to sink deep into the skin, providing more concentrated and longer lasting results. Because the mask itself covers the surface of your skin, it decreases water loss and increases the temperature of the surface of your skin. This creates better penetration of the beneficial ingredients, allowing your skin to remain more hydrated and better able to receive the full results of the mask’s ingredients.
Because of their ability to provide quick, radiant results, celebrities have been using sheet masks for years to prep for special appearances or recover from long press circuits. Many celebrities rely on Dr. Harold Lancer’s Red Carpet Flash Facial, which uses Lancer Skincare’s Lift and Plump Sheet Mask for incredible results. This sheet mask utilizes highly concentrated anti-aging ingredients like apple stem cell compounds and Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3 to provide a tighter and more lifted appearance. Natural humectants, like rose water and sodium hyaluronate, provide intense hydration and help your skin appear healthy and supple.
Even better, sheet masks are significantly less messy than traditional masks, and can even be applied while on an airplane or during a break at work. They come in individual packets, so they are extremely portable and easy to apply and remove. Simply tap the mask onto the face and relax. Sheet masks don’t require water for application or removal, and the remainder of the product in the mask packet can be patted directly on the skin for additional benefits.
In order to achieve full benefits, you should only apply sheet masks to clean, dry skin. Applying a mask to unwashed skin traps impurities and causes them to sink deeper into the skin, resulting in irritation and acne. Help ensure the ingredients can absorb fully by polishing and cleansing your skin thoroughly before application. This will allow all the nourishing ingredients of the mask to work more effectively, without being blocked by dead skin cells.
Those with acne-prone skin should be especially vigilant about washing skin thoroughly before a mask, and should never leave a mask on longer than directed. Leaving a sheet mask on too long allows the skin to overheat, and the increased temperature of your skin can cause an increase in acne-causing bacteria. Consider doing a spot test with your first mask, applying it only on your cheek to make sure you don’t experience an increase in acne in the following few days. If your skin doesn’t react, continue with the full mask as usual. Those with drier skin will also want to avoid leaving masks on longer than recommended, as masks that begin to dry out will dehydrate your skin rather than providing moisture.
Sheet masks provide your skin with much-needed hydration and nourishment, but they also provide you with an excuse to sit back and relax for 10 to 20 minutes. Use the opportunity to take care of your skin—and yourself—and apply a sheet mask once a week. Your skin will thank you.

Why Should I Use a Face Mask? was last modified:  March 30th, 2021 by Dr. Harold Lancer",Why Should I Use a Face Mask?,
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/get-rid-acne-scars/,"Acne can wreak havoc on your skin, but even worse, long after the blemishes themselves are gone, acne continues to ravage your skin with red or brown marks and scars. These marks can be upsetting to you if you have acne-prone skin and they sometimes feel like they’ll never go away. So what can you do about it? First, you need to understand what you’re dealing with before you can treat it properly. Let’s explore the difference between acne scars and red marks. 
What Causes Acne Scars
Often, after a breakout has healed, there are red marks or brown marks left where the blemish was before. This mark is not actually a scar, but rather a spot of discoloration called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). This discoloration is the skin’s response to any wound—like a scrape or a pimple—that has caused inflammation in your skin. As your skin heals, it can produce too much melanin, causing darker, discolored skin that remains after the wound or pimple has already healed. The color of the hyperpigmentation can vary depending on your skin tone, but hyperpigmentation is quite common in those who suffer from acne and can occur with even the smallest pimples. Pimples that are particularly inflamed or have been picked or popped are especially likely to develop hyperpigmentation.
The good news is post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is not a true scar and will fade over time, especially with proper treatment. Depending on the contrast between the PIH mark and your regular skin tone, these marks can take up to two years to fade completely without treatment. However, if they are treated properly, these marks can fade much faster and more effectively, leaving your skin clearer and brighter.
Acne Scar Treatments
Products with Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA) and antioxidants like vitamin C can brighten skin and help lessen the appearance of any discoloration from PIH. Advanced C Radiance Treatment uses stabilized Vitamin C to help lessen the appearance of over-pigmentation. Retinol exfoliates to help eliminate the appearance of discolored surface skin and allows healthier-looking, more even skin to shine through. Dr. Lancer’s Retexturizing Treatment provides a powerful 10% glycolic acid—an AHA—to exfoliate the surface of the skin and brighten discoloration, while also protecting the skin from free radicals with coenzyme CoQ10. For advanced discoloration, try a brightening treatment like Fade Serum Intense with LES 10 Brightening Complex. This powerful combination of red algae extract, sugar cane extract, and licorice root extract—along with other brightening agents—helps reduce the appearance of discoloration and makes skin appear brighter and more even.
PIH is treatable, and the marks will fade over time, regardless of how you treat them. True acne scars, on the other hand, do not fade on their own and require different treatments. There are two kinds of acne scars. The first, hypertrophic and keloid scarring, results from an overproduction of collagen when the body is trying to heal a wound. This causes raised tissue where the wound has healed. The second, atrophic or depressed scarring, results from a loss of tissue, causing the indentation. While AHA or Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA) treatments, including cream treatments and peels, can help smooth the skin and minimize the appearance of the scar, they won’t eliminate the raised scar tissue or indented tissue. To address true scars, you’ll need to look into laser treatments, fillers, chemical peels, and dermabrasion. As each of these procedures carries certain risks, see an experienced dermatologist like Dr. Harold Lancer to determine which of these treatments are right for your skin.
One milder treatment for acne scarring is laser or light therapy, where a gentle yet powerful laser can treat the scars without damaging the tissue around them. A more assertive option for raised scars is ablative lasers, which eliminate the top layers of skin, including acne scar tissue. This permits collagen production, which encourages smoother skin to replace the scar tissue as it heals. Alternately, non-ablative lasers are effective for depressed scars as they activate your skin’s collagen production without damaging the skin’s surface and encourage the new collagen to fill in indented acne scars. Chemical peels can also be effective for acne scars as they remove the outer layer of skin, allowing the smoother new skin layer to come through, making the scars less noticeable. Similarly, microdermabrasion and dermabrasion are possibilities, both of which involve the removal of layers of skin. For particularly indented scars, fillers can be used to plump the indentation and temporarily smooth the surface of the skin. Maintenance is required, but this treatment is minimally invasive and does not involve the risk of discoloration that can come with peels, dermabrasion, and laser treatments.
Additional Steps to Prevent and Protect Acne-Prone Skin
Regardless of whether you have true acne scarring or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, resist the urge to pick at or pop your pimples. Picking and popping can cause more scarring, and can cause bacteria to go deeper beneath the skin than it would have, causing more damage. Do your best to leave your pimples alone. Instead, treat them with acne-fighting skincare that will help treat the skin and keep acne at bay. The Method: 3-Step Blemish Control Set uses potent plant extracts and salicylic acid to help slough dead skin cells and keep pores clear, while lilac stem cell compound and rare grape polyphenol provide anti-blemish benefits and help protect skin cells from environmental stressors. No matter what kind of scarring or marking you’re experiencing, try to stay out of the sun as too much exposure to UV rays can darken your scars and PIH marks, making them more pronounced. If you do go in the sun, make sure to wear a sun hat, protective clothing, and a broad spectrum sunscreen. Sheer Fluid Sun Shield Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen is the perfect choice for acne-prone skin. This sunscreen sooths and calms skin with chamomile extract, while the sunflower sprout extracts and gamay grape stem cells provide a radiant glow and reduce the appearance of UV damage, all without the greasy film of many other sunscreens. You’ll protect your skin and reduce the likelihood of further damage while keeping your skin looking healthier at the same time.
Acne scars and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation can be distressing, but there are ways to treat the marks and prevent further marking or scarring from occurring. With the right preventative skincare and appropriate treatments, you can dramatically reduce the appearance of PIH and acne scarring so that you can enjoy your skin once again.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/take-care-keratosis-pilaris/,"If you’ve ever run your hands across your arms and noticed small, harmless, sandpaper-like bumps covering your skin, you probably have what is called keratosis pilaris. Unlike goose bumps, these often red bumps do not go away. They are the result of a buildup of keratin, which is responsible for protecting your skin from infection and harmful matter. The excess keratin builds up to create a rough plug, blocking the openings to your hair follicles. It’s unclear why the keratin begins to build up in the first place, though it is sometimes associated with genetic diseases and different skin conditions, like atopic dermatitis. It does run in families and is considered a genetic disorder. Drier skin can exacerbate keratosis pilaris.



Keratosis Pilaris : What It Is and How It Manifests
Keratosis pilaris is a common skin condition and is generally considered innocuous, though those living with it often find it frustrating and dislike the look and feel of the rough little bumps. Sometimes called chicken skin, the bumps are generally small, and can be without discoloration, or—depending on your skin tone—pinkish or red, or brownish black. The bumps can become irritated, making them look much like a rash, and can also be accompanied by rough, dry patches. You are at an increased risk of developing keratosis pilaris if you have asthma, eczema, hay fever, or are overweight. Other skin conditions and medications can also make you more likely to develop this condition.
Keratosis pilaris is most common on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks, and buttocks, but can be found anywhere on the body except the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Keratosis pilaris is most commonly found in children and affects between 50 to 80% of all adolescents. It can become worse at puberty, but then it often improves with age. Approximately 40% of adults continue to struggle with this skin condition. The great news is, keratosis pilaris often clears up on its own, without treatment, after several years. Symptoms can improve and worsen with the seasons, and drier skin in the winter often makes symptoms more severe. Regular swimming in a pool can also aggravate keratosis pilaris. There is no cure or prevention for the condition, but it can be treated.

Easy Remedies for Keratosis Pilaris
Before you seek medical care, try some home remedies to see if you can improve your keratosis pilaris on your own. You may not be able to completely eliminate it, but you may see improvement if you take the right measures. First, make sure that you avoid overly hot water when taking showers, baths, and or washing your face. Hot water and extended bathing time actually draws essential oils and moisture from your skin, causing your skin to feel dry and irritated after washing. Try to use warm water instead, and limit bathing to about ten minutes. If you live in a drier climate or run an air conditioner regularly, using a humidifier in your home can also be helpful for maintaining your skin’s ideal moisture level. 
Similarly, using cleansers and soaps that are overly harsh and drying can further aggravate skin irritation. Use cleansers that are gentle on your skin and won’t cause an adverse reaction.

The Lancer Method for Keratosis Pilaris Treatment
While exfoliation is an effective treatment, highly abrasive exfoliants and vigorous scrubbing can cause irritation and can, in fact, damage your skin and worsen the condition. Try a polish that is gentle enough not to scratch your skin, and work softly, polishing in a circular motion. For the skin on your face, The Method: Polish Blemish Control effectively uses salicylic acid—a beta hydroxy acid—to remove dead skin cells and keep pores and hair follicles clear of buildup. The pumpkin and pomegranate enzymes help prepare the surface of the skin for sloughing, without abrasion or irritation. After gently polishing your skin, pat it dry with a clean towel, and avoid rubbing your skin with the towel, which disrupts the vital moisture barrier. 
The Method: Cleanse Blemish Control cleanses the skin of your face with natural exfoliators in a refreshing gel. The combination of salicylic acid and tea tree oil in the cleanser helps maintain clear pores and follicles without over-drying. Lilac stem cell compound also aids in keeping pores and follicles clear of buildup by absorbing excess oil. 
Apply a moisturizer like The Method: Nourish Blemish Control right after cleansing while your skin is still damp in order to seal in hydration. Depending on your moisturizer, the severity of your keratosis pilaris, and the active ingredients in your skincare, you may need to moisturize several times a day. Make sure you wear loose, breathable clothing that won’t create friction and further aggravate your keratosis pilaris.
Regardless of whether your keratosis pilaris is on your face or body, your dermatologist will likely recommend beginning to treat your condition by moisturizing your skin regularly and exfoliating before suggesting you use any sort of medicated cream. Your skincare should contain exfoliating agents that help your skin slough dead skin cells and maintain clear pores and follicles for smoother skin. Begin with The Method: Body Polish, which contains uniform quartz crystals to gently polish without abrading the skin, and salicylic acid, which has anti-microbial properties and softens the excess keratin that clogs the hair follicles and causes the bumps. These two ingredients work together to go deeper to clear follicles of buildup, resulting in softer, smoother skin. Follow up with The Method: Body Cleanser, which also contains salicylic acid, in addition to glycolic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid. These highly effective acids cleanse the pores thoroughly and encourage cell turnover, while reducing the production of sebum. Watermelon seed oil helps keep your skin properly hydrated. The final step for the skin on your body is The Method: Body Nourish, which uses a powerful combination of glycolic acid and Hylaplex®, a moisturizing compound that provides lasting hydration for your skin. These active ingredients work together to create skin that is smoother, softer, and perfectly moisturized.
If regular moisturizing doesn’t do the trick for your keratosis pilaris, your dermatologist may suggest medicated creams containing higher levels of alpha hydroxy acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, or urea. These ingredients help polish and eliminate the dead skin that contributes to clogged pores, as well as aiding in the hydration and softening of your skin. These ingredients are often available over-the-counter in skincare products like The Lancer Method, but prescription strength options are available as well. Depending on the sensitivity of your skin and the strength of the acid you’re using, you may experience redness, stinging, or irritation on your skin. Speak with your dermatologist to determine the ideal strength for your skin. 
Advanced Treatments for Keratosis Pilaris
Additional skin treatments like the Retexturizing Treatment with glycolic acid can help exfoliate your skin to reveal the smoother, suppler skin beneath. However, be make sure you talk to your dermatologist before proceeding with more advanced treatments.
Finally, if none of these treatments are sufficient for clearing your keratosis pilaris, your dermatologist may choose to prescribe an ammonium lactate cream or corticosteroids. For more extreme cases, a laser or light treatment can be used to treat keratosis pilaris as well. Shaving and waxing body hair can aggravate the condition, so your dermatologist may recommend laser hair removal as well. However, these treatments can have lasting side effects and may require multiple treatments, so it is beneficial to try to manage your symptoms with other remedies first. Only a dermatologist can determine the best treatment for you and your skin.
Be aware that no matter how you manage your symptoms, treatment can improve the feel and look of your skin, but as soon as you stop treating and moisturizing, the condition is likely to return. Keratosis pilaris often continues for years, so once you’ve found an effective method of treating it, be diligent about consistently moisturizing and treating your skin properly to keep your skin as smooth and clear as possible.
Keratosis pilaris is harmless, but it can be stubborn and is a frustrating and unsightly condition. Luckily, with proper skincare and consistent treatment, you can polish away the buildup that causes the bumps so skin appears and feels supple and soft. Even if you’ve suffered from keratosis pilaris for years, touchable skin is still within your reach.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/benefits-vitamin-c-treatments/,"You know that vitamin C is good for your body, so you probably already make an effort to eat foods rich in this powerful vitamin. Citrus fruits, peppers, broccoli, strawberries, and papaya are all extremely rich in vitamin C. When you get sick, it is likely you turn to some of the foods with high levels of this restorative vitamin, as well as take vitamin C supplements to boost your immune system and help your body heal. However, you still may not realize quite how essential vitamin C is to a healthy body.

Vitamin C is vital for growing and repairing tissue throughout your body. It helps your body make collagen, which is a vital connective protein used to create blood vessels, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and skin. In order for your body to heal from any wound or damage, vitamin C is necessary for tissue repair. Vitamin C also aids in keeping your bones and teeth strong, as well as helping your body absorb iron. Deficiencies in vitamin C can cause a whole host of problems within your body, from high blood pressure to bleeding gums. Without a doubt, vitamin C is crucial to your health, but it is just as necessary to keep your skin healthy and youthful.
When it comes to your skin, vitamin C is equally potent. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that protects skin and promotes healing. Since vitamin C is essential for the production of collagen in the body, it makes sense that it helps prevent the signs of aging in your skin. As an antioxidant, it provides protection for your skin, too. Antioxidants neutralize free radicals, which can damage the proteins, lipids and DNA in your skin, causing cell damage. Pollution, oxygen, cigarette smoke, and UV rays all damage our skin, but using a topical antioxidant can help defend your skin from further harm. Applied topically, vitamin C has been found to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, as well as aiding in improving the look of skin discoloration. In addition, it boosts your skin’s ability to retain moisture. With its long list of benefits and strong history of research backing up its effectiveness, there is little wonder as to why people flock to skincare with vitamin C.
Still, not all products are created equal. What should you look for in a vitamin C skincare product? First, know that products containing vitamin C—and all other antioxidants, like vitamins A and E—are extremely susceptible to destabilization when they are exposed to either air or light. Any product containing vitamin C should be packaged in an opaque container with a pump release that minimizes the amount of air and light that the product comes into contact with. Next, it’s important to understand the different forms of vitamin C you might find in your skincare so that you can choose the right product for your skin.
Ascorbic acid—also sometimes listed as L-ascorbic acid—is the most common form of vitamin C found in skincare. Thankfully, it’s also the most stable. Time and time again, research has proven that when properly incorporated in a product, ascorbic acid can help lessen the appearance of  hyperpigmentation and sun damage. It also helps skin appear younger, firmer, and more radiant over time. L-ascorbic acid also helps replenish another antioxidant in your skin, vitamin E which inspires an extended youthful appearance.
Other forms of vitamin C you might find in your skincare—but might not be able to pronounce!—are retinyl ascorbate, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, sodium ascorbyl phosphate, tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, ascorbyl glucosamine, and ascorbyl palmitate. These forms of vitamin C have less research behind them supporting their effectiveness, but have still been shown to be beneficial to skin. Nevertheless, these forms of vitamin C are usually incorporated with other anti-aging agents to boost their effectiveness. If you want the ideal outcome for your skin, look for vitamin C in the form of L-ascorbic acid, which offers the best anti-aging results and helps you achieve visibly healthier, glowing skin.
When you’re looking for skincare with vitamin C, pay close attention to the concentration of the antioxidant within the product. Vitamin C is thought to be most effective at concentrations of 5% or higher.
Advanced C Radiance Treatment with Vitamin C Collagen Cofactor 10x contains a 10 percent concentration of stabilized vitamin C to help reduce the appearance of dark spots, hyperpigmentation, and sun damage. This water-free cream also contains retinol, which assists with the resurfacing of the skin. The combination of these two products diminishes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and also helps brighten discoloration for radiant, younger-looking skin. The treatment cream is packaged in an opaque pump bottle to ensure that air and light do not destabilized the vitamin C, allowing the antioxidant to maintain its full strength. You can use this vitamin C treatment to enhance the stimulation of your skin’s repair process in conjunction with other products in the Lancer Advanced Anti-Aging line.
If you’re looking to get the very most out of your vitamin C treatments, try Lancer Skincare’s Enhanced Regimen: Lift and Brighten which pairs your vitamin C cream with a brightening serum for the ultimate in bright, healthy-looking skin. Fade Serum Intense, a lightweight serum containing LES 10 Brightening Complex, is formulated with red algae extract to brighten skin by reducing the appearance of brown spots and hyperpigmentation. Sugar cane extract, a natural source of glycolic acid, and licorice root extract work together to gently polish the skin to reduce the look of discoloration and protect against free radical damage. These benefits, when combined with the powerful effects of Advanced C Radiance Treatment keep skin looking younger, healthier, and more even-toned, with the radiant glow of nourished skin.
Don’t forget to extend your skincare to your neck and chest as well. This part of your body is bombarded by free radicals just as much as your face, and the delicate skin can show the damage even faster. Extend your vitamin C treatment to your neck and chest, too, and help protect your skin from free radicals while reversing the look of damage and photoaging. Make sure to use your vitamin C products, and any other treatments, in combination with The Lancer Method to polish, cleanse, and nourish your way to the ultimate in beautiful, even skin, and always end your morning skincare routine with a broad spectrum sunscreen like Sheer Fluid Sun Shield SPF 30 to ensure your skin is protected from further UV damage.
It is clear that vitamin C is absolutely essential to a healthy body and healthy skin. With the power to protect and improve your skin, vitamin C is a workhorse among skincare ingredients, providing visible results. However, not all products are created equal. Do your research, know what you are buying, and understand the ingredients in your skincare to achieve the very best results for your skin. Using the right skincare and finding the best vitamin C products to address your skin’s unique needs will ensure that your skin stays healthy and younger-looking as long as possible.

With the holiday season quickly approaching, we’re sure you’re wanting to look your best for all of your holiday activities. Many people might think it’s best to look for the “quick fix” products, where a particular ingredient becomes the main marketing focus since it has magical, transformative powers. But what if you were to take the time and find products that have multiple anti-aging ingredients that you can continue to use well past the holidays? Lancer Skincare prides itself on developing products using only the highest quality anti-aging ingredients—find out about some of them below:
Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs) and Glycolic Acid: Both of these acids can be categorized as keratolytic agents. Keratolytic means to remove something, and in this case, these acids act as exfoliants that remove dead and damaged cells, reduce fine lines, age spots, and acne scars. Exfoliating allows other anti-aging ingredients to penetrate faster, deeper, and more effectively because they break down the bond between the dead cells of the stratum corneum (the outer layer of the skin) and the skin beneath it. AHAs are water-soluble, and improve collagen production so skin becomes firmer. Glycolic acid is the common AHA in many skincare products, and may irritate darker skin tones. We recommend introducing AHAs gradually in order to avoid major irritation.
Vitamin C: Antioxidants save cells from environmental damage by turning free radicals into harmless compounds in order to stop them from destroying collagen, elastin, and DNA. Vitamin C is the workhorse of anti-aging ingredients because it is the most abundant antioxidant in your skin. While neutralizing free radicals, it also contributes to collagen production, resulting in plumper skin and the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles.
Vitamin E: If you’re concerned about age spots, scarring, and UV rays, Vitamin E is the antioxidant for you! Vitamin E absorbs oxidative stress from UV radiation, and protects collagen and boosts skin’s natural moisture retention.
Retinoids (Retinol, Retinyl Palmitate): Retinol is a Vitamin A derivative that promotes epidermal thickening by stimulating collagen and elastin production and decreases collagenase, the enzyme that eats up collagen. Retinoids also sweep away dull, dead cells while speeding up cell turnover and repair, which is what the Lancer Method focuses on because if skin acts young, it looks young, too.
What are the Best Anti-Aging Ingredients – The Method
When it comes to looking your best, look no further than Lancer Skincare. You can find many of these ingredients throughout our Lancer Method and Advanced Skincare treatments, like our Advanced C Radiance Cream with 10% Vitamin C and our Retexturizing Treatment Cream with 10% glycolic acid.

Think bundling up and moisturizing are the only things you need to avoid dry winter skin? Think again! Your skin changes every hour, just like the weather, and winter can be especially temperamental on your skin. Here’s how to prep your skin for winter:

Polish from Head to Toe: Polishing (aka exfoliating) removes dead skin cell debris and revives your skin to stay soft, supple, and rosy all winter long. If you live somewhere with lower humidity, polish 2-3 times a week instead of every day or use a sensitive skin polish.
Hydrate: Sugar, alcohol, and coffee intake promote inflammation and dehydration so avoid them! Drink plenty of water to stay well— inside and out.
Nourish: In order to prevent further dryness on your skin, use a high-quality moisturizer such as the Nourish for an extra layer of protection against extreme temperature, humidity, and water loss.
Avoid Hot Showers: Hot water breaks down the lipid barriers in the skin. Stick to warm water and keep your showers short to avoid parched fingers.
Wear Sunscreen: Winter sun and snow glare can still damage your skin. Apply a broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher at least 30 minutes before you go outside and make sure to reapply every 2 hours!

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/throwback-thursday-tbt/,"While every day is a great day for healthy skin, Thursday is becoming one of our favorites. The hashtag #ThrowbackThursday, or #tbt, has allowed everyone to post a favorite memory on social media. If there’s one thing we know, it’s that at Lancer Skincare, fantastic, glowing skin is always memorable (and always in!)
We wanted to take this moment to throwback to a few of the highlights we’ve received in the press this year. Here we go!
Throwback Thursday – Lancer Skincare

To begin, how about that time Harper’s Bazaar gave us a shout out! We discussed skin health in the September 2015 issue.
Around that same time, Cameron Silver, the King of Vintage, tweeted how much he loved us!

I love @DrLancerRx #DrLancer and his team are my dermatologist heroes!
— Cameron Silver (@CameronDecades) September 17, 2015
We’ve also been mentioned by not one, but two Bravo Network celebrities! Here’s a throwback to Lisa Rinna from “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” listing us as one of her favorite skincare brands. 
“@Kncwhite: @lisarinna What is your favorite skincare brand?” I like @KateSomerville @ReneeRouleau @DrLancerRx I use all! — lisa rinna (@lisarinna) May 19, 2015

The other is a more recent mention from “Ladies of London” star Caroline Stanbury! Goes to show that great skincare really can travel overseas!

Wow @DrLancerRx someone wants my skin to glow thank you so much! 💋🙆 pic.twitter.com/WkrAP0yPei
— Caroline Stanbury (@C_Stanbury) October 25, 2015
One of our favorite #tbts are when we hear how someone loves using our products. Hilary Duff mentioned using our Polish when she was pregnant to enhance her Lancer glow!  The Lancer Glow is definitely something to be excited about—just look at Carnie Wilson’s tweet when she found out Jennifer Lopez is one of our clients! 
You see!!!!!! I knew I was not the only one getting the @DrLancerRx GLOW!!!! Woohoooo!!!!! pic.twitter.com/UKZF5rkkDG — Carnie Wilson (@CarnieWilson) February 24, 2015

Victoria Beckham gives us many #throwbackthursday moments, and it’s not just because of the Spice Girls movie! Here’s a throwback to October, when she let us know what she thought of our Contour Decollete.
My new “must have” @DrLancerRx love it! X vb pic.twitter.com/Bex4rwnEHn — Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) October 29, 2015

All of these moments have come together to make a fantastic year for Lancer Skincare, and we really can’t thank our clients enough to trust us with their skin! And to think, their throwback pictures may even make it seem like no time has passed at all.

With the holiday season quickly approaching, we’re sure you’re wanting to look your best for all of your holiday activities. Many people might think it’s best to look for the “quick fix” products, where a particular ingredient becomes the main marketing focus since it has magical, transformative powers. But what if you were to take the time and find products that have multiple anti-aging ingredients that you can continue to use well past the holidays? Lancer Skincare prides itself on developing products using only the highest quality anti-aging ingredients—find out about some of them below:
Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs) and Glycolic Acid: Both of these acids can be categorized as keratolytic agents. Keratolytic means to remove something, and in this case, these acids act as exfoliants that remove dead and damaged cells, reduce fine lines, age spots, and acne scars. Exfoliating allows other anti-aging ingredients to penetrate faster, deeper, and more effectively because they break down the bond between the dead cells of the stratum corneum (the outer layer of the skin) and the skin beneath it. AHAs are water-soluble, and improve collagen production so skin becomes firmer. Glycolic acid is the common AHA in many skincare products, and may irritate darker skin tones. We recommend introducing AHAs gradually in order to avoid major irritation.
Vitamin C: Antioxidants save cells from environmental damage by turning free radicals into harmless compounds in order to stop them from destroying collagen, elastin, and DNA. Vitamin C is the workhorse of anti-aging ingredients because it is the most abundant antioxidant in your skin. While neutralizing free radicals, it also contributes to collagen production, resulting in plumper skin and the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles.
Vitamin E: If you’re concerned about age spots, scarring, and UV rays, Vitamin E is the antioxidant for you! Vitamin E absorbs oxidative stress from UV radiation, and protects collagen and boosts skin’s natural moisture retention.
Retinoids (Retinol, Retinyl Palmitate): Retinol is a Vitamin A derivative that promotes epidermal thickening by stimulating collagen and elastin production and decreases collagenase, the enzyme that eats up collagen. Retinoids also sweep away dull, dead cells while speeding up cell turnover and repair, which is what the Lancer Method focuses on because if skin acts young, it looks young, too.
What are the Best Anti-Aging Ingredients – The Method
When it comes to looking your best, look no further than Lancer Skincare. You can find many of these ingredients throughout our Lancer Method and Advanced Skincare treatments, like our Advanced C Radiance Cream with 10% Vitamin C and our Retexturizing Treatment Cream with 10% glycolic acid.

And when people ask you about your holiday glow, you can actually say you’re showing off your healthy skin, which is what the Lancer Glow is all about.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/what-is-peptide-skincare/,"What is Peptide Skincare?
You may already be integrating peptides into your skincare routine without even knowing it. Peptides are short chains of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. While peptides are usually too big to penetrate the skin barrier, scientists have engineered them in the lab for skincare products so they can be synthesized into different combinations in order to enter the top layer of skin, the stratum corneum, and affect the epidermis and dermis.
Originally used to heal wounds and reduce the formation of scar tissue, peptides are now used to promote the production of normal skin cells. Peptides also help to limit oxidation while creating an anti-inflammatory environment, which creates optimal healing conditions for your skin as you provide the nutrients and anti-aging ingredients necessary for skin to act younger.
Peptides can either be extracted from a singular plant or be linked together in order to create unique peptides to target specific issues. You can find both singular peptides and a unique biopeptide in the Lancer Method’s Nourish, our potent anti-aging moisturizer. Rice peptides improve cell function and increase cell metabolism, which leads to increased collagen production so skin looks firm and plump. The unique biopeptide is a Hexapeptide, which acts as a minor neurotoxin, meaning it can relax nerve cells and block the transmission of signals from nerves to facial muscles. It is believed to act as a “minor” neurotoxin like Botox, since it relaxes wrinkles while also boosting skin’s ability to retain moisture, but more research needs to be done in order to establish its effectiveness.
What is Peptide Skincare – Nourish
And if you’re looking into receiving the full benefits of a peptide skincare regimen, we recommend following-up your nighttime Lancer Method skincare routine with our Intensive Night Treatment with Hylaplex™. Hylaplex™ combines a cross-linked form of hyaluronic acid—your skin’s natural moisture—with reparative peptides in order to boost intercellular flows of water and oxygen. You’ll notice a long-term reduction of fine lines and wrinkles because they are filled with moisture thanks to a long-chain polypeptide.
What is Peptide Skincare – The Method
When you use products that have peptides as an ingredient, you’ll notice how young your skin looks thanks not only due to the increase in collagen production that is responsible for keeping skin firm, but also because of the rapid increase in skin cell turnover. This is the primary focus of The Lancer Method, since skin needs the same regenerative actions in order to be instructed that it needs to continually create new cells. The results will lead to a brighter, younger you in no time.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/lancer-skincare-throwback-thursday-tbt-video-edition/,"Dr. Lancer has been known as the dermatologist to the stars for the last 30 years. With celebrities ranging from the silver screen to television to radio, there are tons of red carpets and events to go to that involve a camera. Even an outing to the gym or to grab a bite to eat could be caught on camera, and that picture could be shared over and over again. This is just one reason why celebrities need their skin to look camera-ready at all times.
So for this Throwback Thursday, we decided to highlight some of the camera-ready (in this case, a video/movie camera) moments that Lancer Skincare has experienced. Whether it’s giving advice on television or discussing skincare with a client, Dr. Lancer is ready to help anyone work towards healthy, fresh-looking skin!
Let’s begin with a celebrity whose career began in front of a camera. Kim Kardashian has been a longtime Dr. Lancer devotee, and in this clip from the famous E! News show “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” Kim visits Dr. Lancer to find out about some red spots appearing on her leg. Find out what it really is, and what advice Dr. Lancer offers Kim to help her control her skin condition.

Another celebrity client that discussed her skincare on camera is actress and former model Denise Richards. She hosted an E! News special in 2011 called “Denise for a Day,” and introduced Dr. Lancer as the dermatologist that makes her skin look and feel great. Dr. Lancer discussed Denise’s favorite facial, which is the Signature Placenta Facial, that cleanses, steams, and nourishes skin with protein-filled serums, a mask, and anti-aging products. Dr. Lancer also shares some skincare tips for you to follow every day!

One skin problem many people deal with is stretch marks. Dr. Lancer visited CBS’ “The Doctors” in 2009 to discuss how stretch marks may be treated. Do you think aloe, olive oil, and cocoa butter are the solution to avoid stretch marks? Since they may resemble a scar, Dr. Lancer actually recommends applying a form of retinol once or twice daily for a month in order to help speed cell turnover, which will help with repairing the skin and potentially fading or removing the scar. Watch below to find out more information (including results of successful treatment), as well as what you should do after your retinol treatment.

Rachel Talbott is a skincare specialist and fashion and beauty blogger/YouTube vlogger, meaning she creates videos that discuss everything from fashion to skincare to her personal life. In this video from 2012, Rachel updates her followers on what her skincare routine is, especially since her skin tends to look dull after using some of the same products after a while. Leading into her video, Rachel mentions that she actually visited Dr. Lancer’s office to discuss her skin with him, and as part of her evening skincare routine, Rachel uses The Lancer Method’s Polish! She describes our Polish as really grainy (which she enjoys), and that is because it includes quartz and sodium bicarbonate crystals that are uniform in size and shape so that you can experience even exfoliation. Find out what else Rachel uses in her skincare routines below, then follow-up by watching her office visit with Dr. Lancer.

And Rachel’s video leads perfectly into our last #tbt video! One of our beautiful patients, Erika, demonstrates how easy it is to get ready for the day using The Lancer Method’s 3 steps of Polish, Cleanse, and Nourish alongside some products from our Advanced Treatments, including our Advanced C Radiance Cream, Eye Contour Lifting Cream, and Sheer Fluid Sun Shield SPF 30. And while our product packaging has changed since 2014, the products’ results have been helping patients, like Erika, look younger and more vibrant for much longer!

These videos showcase just a few moments of people taking the time to learn about the science behind skincare and how to harness it towards skin that is glowing and healthy. With Lancer Skincare at your side, you can work your skin towards being camera-ready, too!

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/anti-aging-eye-care-dark-circles-crows-feet/,"Anti-Aging Eye Care: Fix Dark Circles and Treat Crow’s Feet
Because the skin around the eye is delicate, it is easily susceptible to showing signs of aging. Many clients come in and ask what can be done about dark circles and crow’s feet, so we’ve decided to bring that advice to our blog. But before we get into how to fix dark circles and treat crow’s feet, we need to discuss how they occur.
Crow’s feet can be seen around the corners of your eyes, and are called crow’s feet because of how fine they are and the triangular shape they take, since the eye’s corner is a triangle. These fine lines typically appear around your mid-30s, but can also be noticed during your 20s and 40s. Their appearance makes sense, due to skin’s cell renewal process slowing down as you age, particularly after your 20s. When the skin cell regenerative process slows, the collagen process also slows down. Collagen keeps your skin tight, and when the process slows down or cells are not told to produce more collagen, you will notice fine lines and wrinkles. Crow’s feet can also occur depending on a few external factors, such as how often you smile, squint, or even the position you sleep in, since sleeping can cause skin to crease and become crepey.
Dark circles also have an association with sleep, as they usually appear more prominent when one doesn’t receive enough rest. This isn’t the only cause, however—dark circles can be shadows cast by puffy lids, hollowness that occurs when one ages, thinning of skin that then makes blood vessels more obvious, or may just be a hereditary trait that runs in your family. Another potential cause for dark circles under your eyes may even be due to sun exposure, since the sun signals melanin production, which causes pigmentation.
So, how can you treat this delicate area? The temporary fix is to cover-up these areas with makeup or seek out Botox or other invasive procedures. Before you do that, you should look into finding non-invasive ways that can help you improve these areas.
To begin your anti-aging eye care regimen, you should evaluate some parts of your lifestyle. Consider your sleep position: do you tend to lie on your side or on your belly? That will cause your face to fold into the pillow and put strain on the skin around your eyes. Try to sleep on your back, which doesn’t just benefit your face, but other areas of your body, like the chest, from potential wrinkles. You may also want to consider sleeping with an extra pillow when your eyes are extremely puffy, since elevating your head will get the fluid to move away from your lids.
One of the easiest things you can do to prevent the appearance of crow’s feet and dark circles is to invest in sunglasses. Even when you least expect it, the sun can come out from behind the clouds and cause you to squint, so having a pair of sunglasses on hand will prevent you from being exposed to the sun’s blinding rays.
Puffy eyelids can also contribute to a less than youthful appearance. In order to combat puffiness, make sure that you are adequately hydrated. This means tracking your salt and alcohol intake, as these substances cause water retention and swelling. For every alcoholic beverage you consume, drink a glass of water alongside it. Always make sure to have plenty of water throughout the day to avoid dehydration.
Anti-Aging Eye Care: Fix Dark Circles and Treat Crow’s Feet
And while these solutions can help treat the appearance of crow’s feet and dark circles, you can actually find skincare products concentrated and specifically formulated to deliver anti-aging ingredients to this delicate area. Our Eye Contour Lifting Cream contains a Micro Diffusing Caffeine Peptide (MDCP) Complex a proprietary blend of sheer light diffusers, caffeine-based agents to help the skin look firmer and a powerful anti-aging peptide system. . All you need to do is take your ring finger and gently pat the cream around the eye once or twice daily, and eyes will appear hydrated and refreshed.
As the saying goes, eyes are the window to your soul, and we want to make sure the windows panes are just as beautiful and youthful as you want them to be. Once you try these tips, you’ll discover eyes that look hydrated, instantly younger, and ready to face the world.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/how-to-fix-sun-damaged-skin/,"How to Fix Sun Damaged Skin
Sun damage is typically thought of as sunburns, which are painful to the touch and eventually go fade away. Some burns either turn into a tan, or they peel as part of the healing process. Some people may think that simply treating the burn with aloe vera (which helps with soothing the burn to hopefully prevent the unsightly peeling process) is enough. The truth is that regardless of how the burn heals itself, the damage has been done—and it can continue to build up into something far worse.
Simply put, any exposure to the sun accelerates skin aging. Sun damage, then, can be said to happen whenever you expose your skin to the sun without any protection. And while burns are the most immediate signs of sun damage, it will show itself in other ways—skin can become tan and leathery, develop wrinkles, and your complexion can become mottled and blotchy due to melanin overproducing in some places but not others. Sun damage can also develop into skin cancer, which one in five Americans will develop in his or her lifetime. While not all skin cancers are deadly, dealing with them may require surgery and may result in scarring. This is why it is so important to visit your dermatologist for an annual head-to-toe skin exam to look for any unusual moles, so you can catch signs of skin cancer early before it develops further.

Taking all of this into consideration, you can take preventative steps against further sun damage The first step is obvious: wear sunscreen every day, especially on areas that will be exposed to the sun. Even when you are driving, your hands, arms, and face are susceptible to sun exposure since the sun reflects through the sun’s windows. While you may want to reach for a sunscreen with a high SPF like SPF 100, the difference between SPF 30 and 100 is marginal. Our Sheer Fluid Sun Shield has SPF 30, which blocks 97 percent of UV rays while also protecting skin from photo-aging and free radicals in the air. Our sunscreen feels weightless on your skin, making it an ideal primer.
How to Fix Sun Damaged Skin – Sheer Fluid Sun Shield
Once you have already accumulated sun damage, there are steps that you can take to improve the appearance of it. One way is to exfoliate. What appears as a blotchy complexion is can be a buildup of the top layer of your skin, or stratum corneum, in the form of dead skin cells. This may also be why your skin, particularly sunburned or exposed areas, appear duller than normal. You can remove this layer with our Polish, which is part of The Lancer Method. Available for both the face and body, our Polish contains natural minerals that are all uniform in size and shape so you can target the area without abrading your skin or causing uneven exfoliation. You will also experience the powerful exfoliation power of pumpkin and pomegranate extracts as they also help remove the dead skin cells, while brown sea algae helps the hydration balance. These ingredients help skin look plumper, clearer, and healthier than ever before.
You will also want to look into products that will hydrate sun damaged areas and reduce the appearance of brown or age spots caused by sun damage. As part of our Advanced Treatment line, you can use our Retexturizing Treatment Cream, which contains glycolic acid that breaks down skin cells while also increasing skin’s ability to hold moisture. If you’re more concerned with age spots, try the Fade Serum Intense, a lightweight fluid that contains our LES-10 Brightening Complex and sugar cane extract to gently exfoliate skin and lessen the appearance of pigmentation. These are only a few offerings and tips on how to improve the appearance of sun damaged skin. You can find more products specifically for sun damaged skin on the sun damage concerns page, but we also offer products for other concerns as well. Just remember that it’s never too late to incorporate products that will help put your sun damage concerns at ease—just be diligent about using them, and visit your dermatologist to find out what other steps you can take towards healthier, younger-looking skin.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/skin-brightening-ingredients/,"Skin Brightening Ingredients That You Should Know About
Evenness of skin texture, tone and uniformity of color is a top beauty issue among women globally. The concerns range from reducing mottled and blotchy skin to eliminating sun and age spots. Luckily, there are products that can help bring a natural glow back to their skin: skin brighteners. Skin brighteners are most effective when used every day in order to improve the appearance of those pesky areas of dark and uneven skin tone, and when partnered with a SPF 30 of higher, skin brighteners can even help prevent the formation of future issues. Many of the Lancer Skincare products contain skin brightening ingredients that are safe for everyday use; here are a few skin brightening ingredients that Dr. Lancer especially recommends:
Red Algae Extract
Skin Brightening Ingredients That You Should Know About – Fade Serum
This extract is harvested from marine algae, and can revitalize and moisturize stressed skin. It helps fight against surface redness while also evening the appearance of skin tone. Red algae extract is part of LES-10 Brightening Complex, a proprietary blend developed by Dr. Lancer and found in Fade Serum Intense,  a lightweight fluid formulated to help skin texture and tone look brighter and more even. It also includes sugar cane and licorice root extracts for additional skin benefits.
Phenylethyl Resorcinol
A new lightening and brightening ingredient with strong antioxidant activity, phenylethyl resorcinol is also part of the LES-10 Brightening Complex, and helps protect skin from environmental aggressors like smog, sunlight, and free radicals in the air.
Resveratrol
A powerful antioxidant, resveratrol is found in red grape skin. Surprisingly, turmeric is a source of resveratrol! As another ingredient found in Dr. Lancer’s LES-10 Brightening Complex, it acts as another hyper-antioxidant that helps to protect skin from the damage that skin incurs from the environment.
Licorice Root Extract
Sourced and produced from the roots of the licorice plant, this extract was historically used to treat eczema and psoriasis, and more recently has been found effective to help improve the appearance of uneven skin tone and color. As previously mentioned, licorice root extract is found in Fade Serum Intense, and it can also be found in The Method: Cleanse Sensitive Skin as used for its skin calming properties.
While these are some of the skin brightening ingredients we use, we also offer many skin brighteners that improve skin tone in other ways. Advanced C Radiance Cream contains retinol, which helps to improve skin tone by reducing surface roughness. Surface roughness can also occur throughout the neck, chest, and décolleté, which is why Dr. Lancer formulated Contour Décolleté Firming Concentrate specifically for the unique needs and treatments the skin in those areas of the body require to maintain their healthy, youthful appearance. This serum absorbs into skin in seconds and addresses skin’s natural growth factors to help aid elastin and hyaluronic acid production so skin can look smoother and naturally lifted.
If you’re looking to add to your skin brightening routine, Dr. Lance recently introduced the Dani Glowing Skin Perfector, a skin brightener containing skin luminizers and an Asian botanical blend of evodla fruit and buchu leaf extract to help skin maintain an even tone and improve its natural glow.
You can find the products mentioned above on our Hyperpigmentation and Dullness pages. Knowing what skin brightening ingredients are in your products is important, and we have a feeling that you’ll be amazed at what these ingredients can do once you try a skin brightener for yourself!

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/relationship-affect-your-skin/,"How Does a Relationship Affect Your Skin?
Social contact and supportive relationships are essential for good health and well-being. Being in love, especially, can impact your skin in ways you may not have really thought about before!
When relationships are brand new, you may be all over each other: hugging, kissing, cuddling. These are all good things, as physical touch releases serotonin, the happy hormone, as well as oxytocin, which helps to ease stress and improve your mood. These hormones also impact your skin by giving off a radiant, natural glow, which people tend to refer to as a “Love Glow.”
As wonderful as the love glow is, incorporating your partner into your life may change your daily routine— your eating habits, sleeping habits, and hormone levels can all change for the better or worse. Fun activities may include dining out or drinking more, which may also impact your sleeping patterns. Make sure to drink plenty of water as your drink since alcohol dehydrates the body, and try to stick to a diet full of healthy nutrients and meats, as fried, processed foods and sugar can cause skin to become inflamed and not receive the nutrients it needs to look its best. Keep yourself accountable and plan activities, like a hike or run along the beach, for you and your partner to do together.
And with all the fun you’re having, you may forget to take off your makeup or use a different skincare product. What’s important is being consistent with your skincare routine. Keep a travel-size regimen with you to make sure your love glow doesn’t interfere with your Lancer Glow.
Being in a relationship should be a beneficial experience—you better each other’s lives by bringing out the best in each other—and that goes for your skin, too! Maintain your skincare routine as best as you can, and enjoy all the benefits a healthy, happy relationship can give you.

Fashion is always looking forward to the next thing. So while spring may be on its way, we’re focused on fall fashion being showcased at New York Fashion Week. We were lucky enough to participate in New York Fashion Week by making sure the models walking in BCBGMaxAzria’s show were looking absolutely flawless. The ready-to-wear looks needed clean, ready-to-show skin, and we were happy to provide it with Lancer products like the Lancer® Method and our Lancer® Dani Glowing Skin Perfector.
While each model that walks in New York Fashion Week receives a swag bag full of beauty products, we’re inclined to say that the BCBGMaxAzria models received the best bag of all. Each VIP bag had nearly $500 in makeup, snacks, gift cards for massages and at-home beauty treatments. But our favorite swag item is the Lancer® Lift and Plump Sheet Mask, which the models experienced pre-runway and were able to take home with them! Daily Mail UK called the Lancer® Lift and Plump Sheet Mask “the coolest perk of them all,” and we couldn’t agree more! It’s easy to use and rejuvenates your skin. This highly-concentrated sheet mask features Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3 and Apple Stem Cell Compounds to provide a tighter and more lifted appearance. Rose Water, Centella Asiatica Extract and Sodium Hyaluronate quench skin with natural humectants to help improve hydration and suppleness.

Beverly Hills boasts the best of the best. So to be the best Dermatologist in Beverly Hills is provider no easy task. In the Los Angeles area, clients like successful business owners, figures in the entertainment industry, and celebrities, expect the most premium of care and pampering. This means that only a dermatologist with years of experience and a genuine passion for giving his patients the best possible care, attention, and results would be considered the best of the best. Dr. Harold Lancer first established his private practice in Beverly Hills in 1983, and today he treats over 30,000 patients from every corner of the world. While A-listers may explicit trust Dr. Lancer for their Beverly Hills skincare, he’s also committed to making his products and procedures accessible to anyone who wants better, healthier, younger-looking skin.
Everybody wants dewy, glowing skin like Victoria Beckham and Brie Larson, and fittingly, glowing skin requires the absolute best in Beverly Hills skincare and dermatology. Being the premier Beverly Hills and Hollywood dermatologist means offering only the best and latest state-of-the-art technology, products, and medical aesthetic solutions. Dr. Lancer prides himself on his top-to-bottom approach to anti-aging, stressing high-quality products over procedures, and a light touch for a more holistic, natural and non-surgical approach to caring for the skin.
A Passion for Skincare
Why Dr. Lancer is the Premier Beverly Hills Dermatologist
Like many medical specialists, Dr. Lancer was drawn to becoming the leading Beverly Hills skincare provider from his own experience. At just seven years old, he survived massive burns over 10% of his body. While playing catch in his family’s unheated basement with his brother, he slipped into a vat of steaming water. Luckily, he was wearing a snowsuit at the time, and it not been for that snowsuit, the damage could have been much worse.
Still, the burns were intense and his family did not live near a hospital. At the time, there wasn’t a burn unit or even a dermatologist in the entire city. Acting quickly, his mother reached for traditional remedies that had been passed down to her. Crafting homemade “sheets” to soothe the burns, it was her fast thinking (and knowledge) that aided in his healing.
The family’s physician later helped to clean the wounds and ensure that they healed properly. Watching his physician and his mother work to repair and heal his skin, inspired the future doctor to pursue dermatology. With almost no supplies, these two key adults in his life came up with a way of healing skin that was natural, pain-free, and of course very economical. At the time, no one realized the impact this would have on a boy destined to become the leading Beverly Hills skincare expert.
The Signs of an Expert
Why Dr. Lancer is the Premier Beverly Hills Dermatologist
Throughout his youth, Dr. Lancer concocted skin creams and lotions, which he “tested” on his sister (patients need not worry—none of those products made it onto the shelves!). However, Dr. Lancer’s dedication to experimenting, testing, and finding the absolute best solutions to offer his patients have remained. After completing medical school and specializing in dermatology, he established the foundation necessary to not just become a great dermatologist, but the great dermatologist he is today in one of the biggest, most demanding cities in the world.
By far, Dr. Lancer’s most renowned creation is The Lancer Method®. Available in three versions for different skin types (original, sensitive skin, and acne-prone), this simple 3-step Method includes The Method: Polish, The Method: Cleanse, and The Method: Nourish. It’s the basis for all great skincare regimens, and you can boost the results it delivers with the Lancer Skincare sunscreen, serums, and treatments to create the ultimate Beverly Hills skincare routine. Oprah has celebrated The Lancer Method as one of her “Favorite Things”, and Ellen DeGeneres gave away the product line to her audience members in 2012.
The Making of a Great Dermatologist
Loving what you do is key to not just being happy in your career and life, but being the best at it. Dr. Lancer became the top Beverly Hills skincare provider because of his vested interest in the importance of dermatology. He’s spent decades improving his practice, researching new options, and continues to offer the latest and greatest approaches to each of his clients. He’s provided an avenue to having A-list worthy skin without clients needing to be familiar with a red carpet. For many of his patients, Dr. Lancer has seemingly worked miracles from taming rosacea to reducing acne, age spots, and fine lines.
While Dr. Lancer set out to be the best cosmetic dermatologist and the top Beverly Hills skincare provider he possible could be — what is more impressive is that his colleagues and clients ultimately were the ones to bestowed that on him. Dr. Lancer has developed a throng of faithful followers around the globe who discovered firsthand that his products and procedures are incomparable.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/tips-for-handling-your-sensitive-skin/,"Tips for Handling Your Sensitive Skin
Many people think that they have sensitive skin, but the truth is that all skin is sensitive in varying degrees. Skin on the face, throat, and hands can be particularly sensitive because skin in these areas is relatively thin and regularly exposed to UV rays (even with stringent sunscreen application, exposure to the sun is still more damaging than having the skin regularly covered). The good news is that handling sensitive skin well can prevent damage, wrinkles, breakouts, rashes, and sensitivity from products or exposure to the elements.
A dermatologist defines “sensitive skin” as skin that reacts via bumps, erosion or pustules, or as extremely dry skin that doesn’t offer proper nerve protection, and may become easily flushed. While this holds true, sensitive skin remains a catch-all phrase for skin that reacts adversely to common external stressors (like cold weather or certain products) and internal stressors (like stress or certain foods).
Are You Sensitive?
If your skin has a tendency to show uncomfortable reactions to common stimulants, it is best to avoid over-cleansing or stripping the skin. Be wary of using wash cloths, loofahs, or scrub brushes on very sensitive skin. Your own hands and a gentle, non-foaming cleanser are usually more than enough to give skin a proper cleansing. If you have sensitive skin, but still seek the anti-aging benefits of regular exfoliation, choose a gentle resurfacing product like The Method: Polish Sensitive Skin, which uses finely milled crystals and gentle fruit enzymes to reveal fresh, bright skin without harsh side effects on sensitive skin.
Tips for Handling Your Sensitive Skin
Only pure minerals are used as the exfoliating grains in this product, which is exactly what sensitive skin needs to shine. The Method: Polish Sensitive Skin also has a warming feature, which aids in the gentle removal of unnecessary surface cells without stripping away healthy skin. As faster cell turnover occurs as a result of regular exfoliation, new, younger-looking skin will begin to emerge. If you have a diagnosed reason for sensitive skin, such as eczema, dermatitis or rosacea, The Method: Polish Sensitive Skin can be a great choice for gentle exfoliation.
Sensitive Skin Can Be Beautiful
In some cases, allergies may cause sensitive skin. Your dermatologist can test for allergies with a simple patch test. In these cases, avoiding certain foods or products may help manage your sensitive skin. Otherwise, there are so many potential causes for sensitive skin that it’s nearly impossible to diagnose. Management is key, and properly cleansing, nourishing and moisturizing your skin shouldn’t be overlooked.
Sensitive skin can be either very dry or excessively oily. Extremely dry complexions may result in painful, red, or flaky skin. Using a product like The Method: Cleanse Sensitive Skin as a foundational part of your skincare regimen is essential. Fragrance-free and gentle on your skin, it removes surface dirt and debris with soothing licorice and oat phytocompounds to combat the appearance of redness and soothe irritation. Sometimes simply switching to a gentler, natural daily cleanser can make a big difference in how sensitive your skin is.
When dealing with sensitive skin, a good-quality moisturizer is crucial to skin’s health. Choose a product like The Method: Nourish Sensitive Skin, which is fragrance-free, calming, and rich in hexapeptides and polyphenols to deliver anti-aging results without irritating skin. A moisturizer with antioxidants and phytosterols, like The Method: Nourish Sensitive Skin, helps to protect skin and fight against environmental aggressors and the elements.
Taking care of sensitive skin is simple with The Lancer Method®: Sensitive Skin. Protecting skin from the sun, and monitoring your stress levels creates a strong foundation for your sensitive skincare regimen. Once you ease into it, you’ll discover the healthy, radiant skin that will leave you smiling for years to come.
Just for Makeup Junkies
Tips for Handling Your Sensitive Skin
Ideally, people with sensitive skin should avoid cosmetics entirely, but that is not always feasible. If you do wear makeup, use a foundation formula without added fragrance. If you’re comfortable wearing only powder, that is even better. Steer clear of waterproof cosmetics since they require a special, irritating cleanser to remove them.
For all skin types, but especially sensitive complexions, it’s important to avoid sharing cosmetics, clean your brushes regularly, and throw out cosmetics as they age. Makeup does have a shelf life, and for good reason. Lipsticks and mascara over six months old should get the boot.
If you are curious about a new product, conduct a patch-test before applying to your face to see if your skin reacts negatively to the product. Behind the ear is a safe place, as it is similar to the skin on your face and is not near a critical area (like eyes or nose), and it can be hidden if you do have a reaction. Remember to also introduce products slowly into your skincare regimen—we recommend allowing 2-3 days in-between using a new product to make sure skin adjusts accordingly.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/what-factors-cause-rosacea/,"It is estimated that one in ten people is afflicted with Rosacea, and while it is not a dangerous condition, it can be uncomfortable and very frustrating. Rosacea is a lifelong condition that tends to ebb and flow over the course of a person’s life. Rosacea has gathered more attention in recent years as dermatologists begin to understand more completely what triggers rosacea and how it can change over a person’s lifetime. In fact, it has become known that celebrities and famous figures, like Princess Diana and Bill Clinton, have dealt with the skin condition.
The first and most common sign of rosacea is when a person blushes or flushes faster or more severely than most people. This isn’t a guaranteed sign of rosacea (some people really do just blush more!), but it may be a symptom. Only a dermatologist can diagnose rosacea, even though there is no definitive test for it.
It’s Not All Rosy
Contrary to popular belief, rosacea isn’t always confined to the face. It’s most common in the cheeks, nose, forehead, and chin but can also impact the ears, chest, and back. Rosacea can come and go, or it can be chronically present. There are four types of rosacea:


Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea: Common signs include redness, blushing, and obvious blood vessels.


Papulopustular rosacea: Identified by redness, breakouts that look like acne and swelling in the affected areas.


Phymatous rosacea: With this type of rosacea, skin becomes bumpy and thick, especially around the nose.


Ocular rosacea: This form of rosacea is often initially misdiagnosed as a sty, as it shows primarily on the eyelids and around the eye area. Swelling and redness are common.


It’s best to learn how to manage rosacea so that symptoms do not become uncomfortable or problematic. When left untreated, a person can develop permanent redness of the skin. Knowing what causes rosacea is the first step in its management.
Are You Accidentally Irritating Your Rosacea?
People with English or Irish heritage over 30 years old are most likely to be afflicted with rosacea, but it can affect anyone of any age. Although there is no definitive cause of rosacea, dermatologists have a much better understanding of the condition and how to manage it thanks to better research in to the effects of lifestyle and diet on our skin.
One of the most common causes of rosacea is sun damage. Wearing sunscreen whenever you are outdoors and re-applying it every two hours is key in protecting your skin. Choose a product with at an SPF of at least 30, formulated to protect against both UVA and UVB rays. Dr. Lancer formulated his Sheer Fluid Sun Shield SPF 30 as a broad-spectrum sunscreen that also hydrates the skin without any heaviness or greasiness.

Skin with blood vessels very close to the skin’s surface is another common cause of rosacea. The likelihood of experiencing this type of rosacea is largely dictated by genetics and ethnicity. However a non-invasive laser therapy can help to reduce the appearance of broken blood vessels and overall redness. There’s no cure for rosacea, but educating yourself, making lifestyle adjustments, and finding the right products can make a big difference.
Avoid Unhealthy Cycles
About 14 million Americans have rosacea, and while it technically cannot be “cured,” it can be treated. It is well known that certain foods, especially dairy and spicy foods, are major rosacea triggers. Cutting these foods out of your diet one at a time can help patients trying to diagnose rosacea help to identify what may be causing their symptoms. In some cases, a dermatologist might prescribe antibiotics, which can offer relief from symptoms and improved aesthetics, but it’s not a permanent solution.
It’s common for patients dealing with rosacea to try to cover up their symptoms with thick foundations and powders. If you choose to cover your symptoms, Dr. Lancer recommends seeking a foundation that’s alcohol free or mineral-based. It’s also important to follow a skincare regimen formulated for sensitive skin to avoid stripping the skin of its protective moisture barrier.
Getting to the Nitty Gritty
There are a few other, more rare factors that can be contributing factors to rosacea. One such cause is the microscopic mite called Demodex folliculorum. These tiny parasites are a part of our naturally occurring skin biome, and they’re actually helpful in the shedding of dead skin cells. However, those with rosacea may be sensitive or even allergic to them.
A bacteria found in the gut, H. pylori, is also understood as a potentially antagonizing rosacea symptoms. It creates a protein called bradykinin, which causes blood vessels to dilate, which is thought to cause the flushing seen in skin. This is thought to be a potential cause of some rosacea cases.
Rosacea symptoms can also be caused by a variety of lifestyle triggers: There are also a number of potential triggers, hot foods and drinks, hot baths and steam rooms, caffeine, humidity, excessive exercise or stress, and corticosteroids are all known triggers. Alcohol can also exacerbate the symptoms as well as certain medications. Dr. Lancer recommends that patients seeking relief from their rosacea symptoms keep a journal, recording what you eat and do during the day to help discover potential triggers. Keeping a record of your skin’s symptoms can be helpful for patients visiting a dermatologist so that they can devise the best possible treatment plan for each individual patient.

If you do have rosacea, do not worry, you’re not alone. There are many approaches to managing the condition and addressing uncomfortable symptoms. If someone in your family has rosacea, you’re more likely to have it, too. Start considering triggers and making lifestyle changes—like improving your skincare regimen—to battle the condition. We recommend  The Lancer Method®: Sensitive Skin as a way to work your way back to a natural, healthy, and rosy Lancer glow that you can be proud to show the world.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/importance-of-manual-exfoliation/,"The Importance of Manual Exfoliation
Everyone has their own distinct bedtime routine; perhaps it begins with watching their favorite TV show, then brushing their teeth, washing their face, and finally climbing back into bed to wind down with a book or magazine or the news. While there can be an infinite number of variations on a typical bedtime routine, there is one important aspect of hitting the sheets that shouldn’t be ignored; exfoliating. Many people mistakenly believe that by simply using a cleanser to wash their face, they’ve done enough to rid their skin of any makeup, dirt, or free radicals from their day. Although some cleansers can be excellent for removing makeup, simply washing your face leaves residual debris from throughout your day lingering on your “clean” complexion. These debris leads to clogged pores, uneven skin tone and other unsightly side effects.
The potential side effects of sleeping with dirt and debris on your skin are the reason behind Dr. Lancer’s emphasis on the importance of daily exfoliation. Dr. Lancer stresses the importance of using an exfoliant—or polish, as we call it—before using your cleanser for all of his patients. Although this may sound unusual to some, it’s a highly effective way of caring for your skin, which contributes to more effective cleansing and better aging prevention. We’ve discussed the differences between mechanical and chemical exfoliation, but we want to stress how taking exfoliating into your own hands is a critical step in your skincare routine.
The Importance of Manual Exfoliation – Polish
We like to call exfoliating “polishing” because it provides one of the best images as to why The Lancer Method® is so successful in uncovering radiant skin. Just as you might polish a tarnished piece of silver to bring back it’s shining beauty, Polishing your skin allows dead and dry skin cells to be swept away, revealing the radiant, youthful skin below. Exfoliating before cleansing is instrumental in preventing clogged pores and a dull complexion. When you use an exfoliant like the The Method: Polish, you are able to feel the superfine quartz and sodium bicarbonate crystals that provide even exfoliation without the risk of abrading the skin. Pumpkin and pomegranate extracts help to additionally break down dull, dead cells to more effectively clear your complexion. Once Polish has effectively lifted away the dirt and debris from your skin, your cleanser steps in to wash away all the particles remaining on your skin. In this way, your complexion is fully cleansed, with no pollutants or dirt left behind.
While you may have heard the rumor that you should only exfoliate once to twice a week, Dr. Lancer encourages daily exfoliation. Many exfoliants are formulated with uneven materials which may abrade the skin, like nut shells and particles. The Lancer® Polish, on the other hand, is composed of finely tumbled, uniform crystals, chosen specifically for their ability to effectively exfoliate the skin without causing micro-cuts or abrasions. A dose of brown sea algae also provides topical moisture, so skin is never stripped of its natural hydration.
The Importance of Manual Exfoliation – Nourish
When you gently exfoliate your skin every day, you’re able to Polish away skin’s dull surface layers, causing a chain reaction in the skin cells so that they regenerate more quickly in order to replace those sloughed-off cells. This results in skin that is fresher-looking, and more even. The Lancer® Polish’s gentle exfoliation, followed by The Lancer Method’s system of cleansing the residual exfoliant debris creates the perfect canvas for the luscious anti-aging ingredients found in The Method: Nourish. Following these three simple steps will leave your complexion rejuvenated and glowing.
For skin that will not only look and feel super clean, but smooth and glowing, try The Method: Polish. Once you see the results, you’ll understand even more why it is so important to manually exfoliate your skin every day before you cleanse.

An exfoliant, or polish as we call it, should instantly make your skin feel silky and smooth. In order to find the right exfoliant for you, you need to understand what types of anti-aging face exfoliants exist and what they should be doing to make you look brighter and younger.
There are two types of exfoliants: mechanical and chemical. Mechanical exfoliants range from loofahs to rough washcloths to scrubs with tiny grains or crystals that will rub off dead skin cells. Chemical exfoliants are made of enzyme-based ingredients from plants like papaya and pineapple that are capable of dissolving dead skin cells. The emphasis on removing dead skin cells is important because their removal will allow your other skincare products to penetrate the skin better. Not only that, but exfoliating is what stimulates collagen production and skin cell turnover, meaning skin will look taut and fresher with the right exfoliant.
When looking for the best anti-aging face exfoliant, you want to make sure the scrubbers are superfine—it should not feel like sandpaper and should have enough emollient to feel comfortable on your skin. Large mechanical exfoliants can abrade the skin and cause irritation. We recommend avoiding exfoliants with almond or walnut shell powders, as they may contain sharp, uneven particles that are too harsh on facial skin. You also want to make sure that your exfoliant instantly makes your skin feel silky and smooth; if you notice that your skin is drying out, limit your exfoliating to once a week and build up your tolerance from there.
What is the Best Anti-Aging Face Exfoliant – Polish
The big question is whether you should use a mechanical or chemical exfoliant for the best anti-aging results, and our answer is to find a combination of both exfoliants. The Lancer Method’s Polish is a combination of mechanical exfoliants quartz and sodium bicarbonate crystals to create the exfoliation that will rub skin cells off while plumping the skin with controlled inflammation, and chemical exfoliants like pumpkin and pomegranate extracts that breakdown peptide bonds in surface cells so dead skin cells can be sloughed off. Your skin will experience a rosy glow due to increased circulation and oxygenation, all thanks to proper exfoliation.
Exfoliation is central to beautiful skin, and once you try The Lancer Method’s Polish and notice that your skin looks younger within a week, you’ll never have to ask yourself this question again.

Winter is the season that epitomizes what it means to layer clothing: scarves, jackets, hats, earmuffs, and mittens are abundant and, while fashionable, serve the important function of keeping you warm. Many people may also be under the impression that all of these layers also help to protect them from the wind chill that tends to dry skin out and lead to chapped lips and hands; however, this is a common misconception. Your skin needs to breathe, and wearing layers does not allow for that. Instead, you’ll most likely see red patches and more acne, which occurs because dead skin cells build up and clog pores. What this all leads to, really, is how important it is to take care of your skin properly.
Do I Need SPF in the Winter – The Method
For the problems mentioned above, following The Lancer Method’s Polish, Cleanse, and Nourish will help to make sure dead skin cells are sloughed off while maintaining their natural moisture level. While you also receive the additional benefit of maintaining healthy, youthful-looking skin, you are most likely skipping one of the most important steps to any anti-aging routine, which is to wear sunscreen every day, including during the winter.
You may not see the sun behind the winter clouds, but it’s there and waiting to peek out and reflect on water puddles, car windows, or snow. This reflection causes sun rays to hit your skin, resulting in UV ray exposure. UV rays counteract the healing peptides, antioxidants, and other ingredients in your anti-aging skincare products, which is why you still need to apply sunscreen with SPF during the winter.
Do I Need SPF in the Winter – Sheer Fluid Sun Shield
At Lancer Skincare, we never leave the house without applying our Sheer Fluid Sun Shield SPF 30, which combats 97% of UV rays while delivering anti-aging ingredients like chamomile extract to sooth and calm dry winter skin while Gamay grape stem cells protect against UV stress. And don’t be fooled by higher SPFs—there is only a marginal different between SPF 100 and SPF 30, so you want to make sure to apply sunscreen that will nourish your skin. Because our Sheer Fluid Sun Shield feels completely weightless, you can apply it as a make-up primer and to any exposed skin without feeling greasy. We want your skin to look its best through every season, so make sure to apply your sunscreen every 2-3 hours for optimal sun protection.
So when it comes to sunscreen, always think yes, regardless of weather. And once you apply our Sheer Fluid Sun Shield SPF 30, we bet you’ll realize protecting yourself from the sun feels unbelievably good.

When dealing with dry skin, we bet that you slather on lotion until your skin looks and feels moisturized. While of course this is the logical thing to do, have you looked at the ingredients in your moisturizer?
When nourishing products are well-formulated, you’re able to deliver important nutrients your skin needs to repair and protect itself from the aging process while also helping retain moisture.
When looking for relief from dry, aging skin, you most likely consider lotion or moisturizers. We recommend our Nourish, a potent anti-aging treatment available for both face and body that aids cell function and metabolism while boosting oxygen levels to provide a healthy glow. By studying how cells function and their regenerative process, Lancer Skincare has been able to help many clients achieve the results in visibly glowing skin in as little as 3 to 5 days.
The first thing you should notice when looking at the ingredients in your moisturizer is the amount of antioxidants in the formula. Various antioxidants use different metabolic pathways to protect the skin. You’ll find rare grape polyphenol, which is a potent antioxidant that protects mitochondrial DNA from oxidative stressors like smog, UV rays, or free radicals in the air. Our Nourish also contains biopeptides that act as a minor neurotoxin while relaxing wrinkles and boosting skin’s ability to retain moisture.
If you want to ensure that your skin receives even more nourishment, you can expand your moisturizers to include other creams and serums that can provide your skin with potent antioxidants and weightless moisture. Our Advanced C Radiance Cream contains 10% vitamin C, which happens to be the most abundant antioxidant in your skin. This formula contains stabilized vitamin C, which stimulates collagen production so skin remains lifted and full, and shea butter to assist with skin regeneration while providing soothing moisture. If you are experiencing extremely dry skin, our Intensive Night Treatment is an ultra-hydrating cream that treats the skin with essential fatty acids and antioxidants like Marula oil and soybean extract to dramatically increase your skin’s ability to retain moisture and reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.
With any nourisher, you want to make sure that it feels good on your skin. Applying something that feels luxurious and allows your skin to feel its softest will make you look forward to using it rather than forgetting about it. It’s important to make sure that your skin receives all the anti-aging benefits possible so it looks young and healthy, and Lancer Skincare offers the best moisturizer for your anti-aging concerns. Make sure to look through our products, and discover how a well-formulated, anti-aging moisturizer can make your skin can work itself to looking moisturized, plump, and glowing.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/what-does-stress-do-to-your-skin-and-tips-for-de-stressing/,"What Does Stress Do to Your Skin and Tips for De-Stressing
Stress can be either mental, emotional, or physical. Your brain interprets your environment, and when you feel psychologically stressed, it’s your brain that activates the fight-or-flight response meant for physical stress. The fight-or-flight response provides a boost of energy, causing your breathing and heart rates to increase in order to deal with short periods of stress. And just like our daily lives, stress can fluctuate in its intensity.
Your skin acts as the interface between your environment, mind, and body, and is sensitive to the same signals that cause the stress response. When you react to a perceived threat—which can be mental, physical, or emotional—your body produces cortisol, the major stress hormone, alongside adrenaline to pump up your body’s nervous system and provide an energy burst to combat the threat. This reaction occurs regardless of whether the stress comes from a physical or mental place, and while the burst is only to combat stress for a short period of time, life accrues many stressors that may put you into a chronic state of stress that will harm your skin.
When cortisol levels stay elevated, skin rejuvenation becomes impaired and inflammation occurs throughout the skin. Cortisol constricts blood vessels, causing blood pressure to rise as the body attempts to deliver oxygen to the muscles. This may cause dullness due to the clamped blood vessels being unable to deliver proper blood flow to the skin, or redness due to reactive blood vessels opening too widely.
Cortisol also blocks insulin, causing blood sugar levels to rise to provide the body with a quick energy source. Because of this elevation of blood sugar, fine lines and stress wrinkles are more likely to appear due to glycation, which damages collagen and elastin.
Other signs of stress may be skin becoming dry and dull, due to chronic stress impairing the skin’s lipid barrier and resulting in water loss, alongside flakiness due to skin cells turning over too quickly. This buildup of dead skin cells on the skin’s surface will also lead to acne, due in part to the excess cortisol promoting inflammation throughout the skin, which also breaks down the collagen and elastin that would keep your skin taut and young-looking.
It’s important to remember that stress occurs in many different ways, and while you may not be able to control what triggers your stress, you can control how you react to it. Here are a few tips to keep in mind to de-stress your life:
Assess your mindset.
This means looking at the way you interpret events as being positive or negative. Your interpretation of how something should be creates expectations that you inherently live by. Ask yourself if you are an optimist or pessimist, and figure out if you are an extreme of one or the other. If you’re an optimist, a little pessimism serves as a good reality check, whereas if you’re a pessimist, a realistic sense of optimism can provide a sense of motivation. To figure out where you land on the mindset scale, journal your experiences. When in a negative situation, write down how you felt and what you did to deal with it. If you notice that you tend to have more negative reactions, try to reframe your thoughts, because the negativity will build up into stress before you know it. Although stress cannot be avoided, you can respond in more positive ways and minimize the negative effects.
That being said, you can try to avoid stressful situations. If you know someone who stresses you out, try to limit your exposure to them to reduce the intensity of the experience. If you find yourself getting stressed out before work due to traffic, see if you can try an alternate route or leave a little earlier to avoid traffic altogether.
Anticipate your stressors.
If you can anticipate your stressors before they happen, you can better manage your situation. When you have a lot on your plate, pare down your to-do list and prioritize the things that need to be down right away. Communicating your feelings and asking for help are other ways to anticipate your stressors—the most important thing is to not feel like you’re bottling in your stress.
Adjust your standards. 
As mentioned earlier, you inherently have expectations for how situations will turn out. When a situation doesn’t line up with that expectation, it may cause you stress, especially if you are a perfectionist. You can create some distance from the situation immediately by taking a moment to ask yourself whether the situation will matter in a month, a year, or five years. Once you determine your answer, you can dilute your sense of urgency and the significance of the event on your overall well-being.
Exercise.
Stress, especially emotional stress, triggers metabolic problems that can result in obesity, hypertension, and high cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as dysfunction in the cell walls. Exercise uses cortisol and the burst of energy from the fight-or-flight response to bring your body back into balance. If you work up a sweat, exercise can also release impurities from your body that would clog your pores, so there are additional skin benefits, too.
Make time to do things you enjoy. 
This seems like just another task to add to your day, but you may already be doing this without even realizing it. Ask yourself how you unwind from a day of work—is it watching your favorite TV show, cooking, or listening to music? If you use your weekend to run errands for the week, why not schedule a massage or something indulgent for an hour? When you set time aside to do something you enjoy, you’ll feel refreshed, rejuvenated, and ready for the rest of your day.
When it comes to stress and stress management, try to take a moment to step away from a situation. Whether it’s a five-minute stroll to clear your mind or an hour in a warm bath, find out how you anticipate and manage your stress. Your mind, body, and skin will thank you for it.

You’ve probably been told not to pick your pimples due to the bacteria spreading and potentially causing scarring; however, picking acne also increases inflammation, which plays a key role in how acne scars occur. Inflammatory acne is usually seen as swollen, reddish, and painful acne that tends to penetrate deep into the skin, and depending on your genetics, it may lead to scarring. Scars can be categorized in two different ways: depressed (think saucer-like pits in the skin) due to the skin losing its underlying support, or raised (thick, rubbery, and large scars that are usually seen around the chest, shoulders, and upper back).
There are many treatments for acne scars, like acne surgery that removes, raises, and fills depressed scars to create a smaller scar, or intralesional injections every two-six weeks to help reduce raised scars.
While these invasive quick-fix solutions might be more expensive than what you’re looking for, Lancer Skincare has affordable solutions to treat and reduce acne scars using the natural healing powers of your skin.
To treat acne scars, we have to acknowledge how the acne first occurred. Acne lesions form when pores are blocked by dead skin cells and sebum, your skin’s natural oil. Bacteria feeds on this mixture, which then causes inflammation. Products containing glycolic acid and salicylic acid work to remove dead skin cells, clean pores, reduce inflammation, and stimulate the growth of new, smooth skin that reduces the appearance of acne scars. Products may also contain lactic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and/or sulfur that also remove dead skin cells and excess oil from the skin. The Lancer Method for Blemish Control focuses on polishing the skin gently to bring oxygen to the skin, which speeds up blemish healing, while also using natural blemish fighters like tea tree oil and B3 to quiet inflammation during the Cleanse and Nourish steps that not only continues fighting the causes of acne, but delivers potent anti-aging benefits that will leave your skin looking younger. For those who have depressed scars, The Method will stimulate collagen production, which supports your skin by keeping it supple and resilient.
The best way to treat acne scars is to ease your skin into a solid regimen, which includes looking at your lifestyle and finding the causes for inflammation. Try to eliminate sugar, salt, and simple carbs from your diet, as these all lead to inflammation. When you first begin your skincare regimen, we suggest using the polish (which inflames the skin to activate its regenerative process) every other day for the first week, and building it up to slowly to using it twice a day. Before committing to any invasive treatment, make sure to discuss your options with your dermatologist. Your skin has a natural way of healing itself, so take the time to explore all your options and see how healthy skin can help with your acne.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/10-ways-to-age-your-skin-prematurely/,"10 Ways to Age Your Skin Prematurely
We’re sure you’ve heard the saying, “Age is nothing but a number.” The saying gets its positive connotation due to not feeling like the age you’re “supposed to” feel like. Researchers Sergei Scherbov and Warran Sanderson conducted a study in 2013 that suggested that certain biological characteristics, like health and cognitive function, impact age. So yes, you may feel younger based on your lifestyle, but how do your hobbies impact how your skin looks? If you want your skin to look as young as you feel, here are ten precautions to follow to make sure your skin doesn’t age prematurely:
Sun Exposure: Not wearing sunglasses leads to squinting, which causes crow’s feet and frown lines, and being exposed to the sun without sunscreen means UV damage. Make sure to wear at least SPF 30 on your skin every day, and leave a spare pair of sunglasses in your car for those bright morning drives.
Smoking: Smoking depletes the body of vitamin C, which keeps skin plump and moist, which is why a smoker’s skin will normally develop into deeply wrinkled, leathery skin. Cigarette smoke triggers biochemical changes that accelerate aging, so even being around secondhand smoke can be bad news for your skin. Try to avoid smoke when you can, and if you are a smoker, try to quit.
Alcohol: Alcohol is a diuretic that dehydrates the body, so skin becomes scaly and taut. One or two glasses of wine every once in a while is okay, but it’s best not to be excessive. When you order a drink or have one at home, have a glass of water with it, too, to make sure you stay hydrated.
Not Exercising: Exercise isn’t just to stay fit anymore. When you exercise, you increase circulation and blood flow to the skin, meaning more oxygen and nutrients travel throughout your body. The result is not just glowing skin due to blood flow and natural oil production, but a smooth appearance, too.
Eating Processed Foods: In order to prolong their shelf-life, processed foods are loaded with salt, sugar, and fat. Sugar and salt cause inflammation and can also lead to wrinkles and acne. We highly advise an organic diet of fruits, vegetables, and lean meats to avoid consuming any unnecessary chemicals that are unfamiliar your body.
Weight Cycling: Also referred to as yo-yo dieting, weight cycling puts too much stress on both your skin’s elasticity from constant stretching your hormones, which can lead to inflammation from too much cortisol (the stress hormone). Monitor your weight and work toward your goal by following a healthy diet and exercise regimen.
Not Getting a Good Night’s Sleep: Your skin does most of its regenerative work while you sleep. When you deprive your body of rest, it leads to dull skin, dark circles, and fine lines.
Sleep Position: Sleeping on your side causes your cheek, jawline, and neck to be pushed against the pillow, meaning your skin could be folded or creased for several hours. Sleeping on your back is your best option to avoid potential wrinkles since there will be no pressure on your face.
Stress: Stress doesn’t just appear as acne—because cortisol levels are elevated, free radicals in the air can impair your skin’s renewal process by destroying your collagen and elastin production. Find a way to manage your stress: make a check-off list, take relaxing breaths, or find a way to pamper yourself however often you need to do so.
Not Having a Good Skincare Regimen: Do you forget to take off your makeup or don’t have the time to moisturizer? A good skincare regimen should not only clean your skin, but make sure it’s looking its best today and for years to come. Meet with a dermatologist to figure out a maintenance and treatment program to look young and fresh.
Ready to break these bad habits? We recommend The Lancer Method, where you’ll Polish, Cleanse, and Nourish your skin to act the way you feel while you ease into changing your lifestyle. And remember to ease into it—change is a process, and you will have a better chance at skincare success when you take the time to care for yourself.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/5-surprising-things-that-are-very-beneficial-for-your-skin/,"5 Surprising Things That Are Very Beneficial for Your Skin
With school and work back in session with no vacation plans in sight (until the holidays, perhaps), you may forget how important it is to treat yourself—and your skin. Stress from studying or work may appear in frown lines or wrinkles, and your daily perk-me-up coffee will create excess cortisol that accelerates the aging process and dehydrates your body. Besides monitoring your stress and reducing your caffeine consumption, we’ve thought of 5 surprising things that are beneficial for your skin and will potentially impact your well-being.
1. Organic Foods 
Your body gains energy and vitamins from the food you eat. Conventionally-raised foods often contain hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides that are designed to be toxic. These chemicals are not recognized by your body, and will result in an inflammatory response due to hormone imbalance. Switching to organic produce and organically-raised meat and poultry will help you avoid these toxins and allow your body to function naturally.
2. Eating Citrus Peels
In 2013, the University of Arizona monitored people who ate citrus fruits, juices, and peels weekly, and discovered that those who ate the peels had a 33% decreased risk for squamous cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer. The peels contain limonene, a compound found in the peel’s oil that offers UV-protective benefits. Peels are often used as a garnish or as zest in recipes, so the next time you’re cooking our Younger-Approved Easy Baked Salmon, try adding some lemon zest on top for extra skin benefits.
3. Vitamin C
You can get your internal dose of Vitamin C by consuming oranges, pineapples, kale, broccoli, and other foods, but what if you had the opportunity to apply Vitamin C directly to your skin? Stabilized Vitamin C, or Ascorbic Acid, acts as a collagen production co-factor and a powerful antioxidant that increases oxygen flow to the skin. We recommend using our Advanced C Radiance Cream, a water-free cream with 10% Vitamin C and retinol to help boost skin’s radiance. Because this cream is water-free, the Vitamin C remains stable and active while it boosts cell repair and reduces inflammation from external factors like sun, smog, and pollution.
4. Tepid water
Although hot water may be your answer to waking up in a hurry and creating that sauna effect in your bathroom, both the water and steam wash away natural oils and leach moisture from your skin. Hot water also aggravates sensitive skin. For bathing and washing your face, it’s best to use tepid water.
5. Yeast
Although yeast products, like bread and other baked goods, cause inflammation, it has been showing up in makeup and skincare lines. There is a species of yeast called saccharomyces cerevisiae—baker’s yeast—that can produce an anti-aging by-product when put through a biotechnological process. Yeast contains amino acids, proteins, and antioxidants that bring a youthful complexion due to its moisturizing properties. Plus, you may see yeast in your makeup, since the beauty industry is looking into more “green chemistry” to create eco-friendlier makeup.
It’s amazing how making small changes in your lifestyle can benefit your skin and well-being. We hope these 5 beneficial skincare ideas surprise you with how fresh and radiant your skin will look once you make them a part of your younger-looking skin and anti-aging lifestyle!

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/the-secret-of-the-lancer-method-interlocking-chemistry/,"Interlocking chemistry is not just some heady term you hoped you’d never hear again after narrowly passing science class, it’s the secret behind The Lancer Method (Polish, Cleanse, Nourish). The Method was developed as an integrative three-part system, wherein each step, or product, makes the others more effective. Though this might sound like mad science, it’s based on the most basic principle of pH and our skin’s acid mantle. Skin is naturally slightly acidic, and it’s this acid mantle that protects from bacteria, infection etc. Many cleansers, especially those of lower quality, can leave the skin stripped of it’s natural acid barrier; thus leading to irritation, redness, acne breakouts and other problems. Our Polish is designed to sweep skin of dead cells and debris; The Method Cleanse is designed to not only clean off the lifted cells, dirt and other debris, but also to restore the skin’s pH to protect the natural acid barrier.  The result is smooth skin that is prepared to receive the nurtrients and hydration in Nourish, with no “toner step” needed.

But the ladies weren’t all we were obsessed with last night. The guys looked pretty gorgeous themselves. Our picks for Best Supporting Skin? Channing Tatum’s scruffy-meets-smooth look, Common’s polished perfection and Steve Carrell’s lovable – and handsome – mug.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/glowing-skin-hacks-for-the-day-of-a-big-event/,"The Oscars are this Sunday and although you may be watching from the comfort of your own couch rather than attending, there are plenty of skincare hacks you can steal from the stars for your own big days. On the day of a major event, you should take a three-pronged approach of activity, diet and skincare to prep:
Activity: Start the morning with light exercise for an energy boost, to increase blood circulation for a healthy glow, and to keep your metabolism active throughout the day.
Diet: Staying uber-hydrated and avoiding foods that cause bloating are key if you’ll be sliding in to a black tie dress and want your skin in tip-top shape. Things to avoid: salt, sugar, grains and alcohol. Fill up on lean protein, fresh veggies and healthy fats instead.
Skincare: In terms of topical skincare, don’t do anything aggressive that would strip or inflame the skin, such as using acids or drying agents. Instead, stick with pampering and hydrating products and treatments. A hydrating mask the night before a big event can do wonders!

Rather than relying on invasive measures or miracle ingredients to keep skin looking young, we always recommend the natural route first.  With young skin, cell renewal happens every 28 days. However, as aging occurs, the skin stops renewing itself at the same rate, resulting in dull, sallow skin, a lack of collagen and elastin, and eventually wrinkles and sagging.  But here’s the good news: You can fight this slow-down with manual exfoliation and recreate the lit-from-within glow of youth – and all it takes is a little scrub. By using Polish, you physically stimulate the skin to speed up the cell renewal cycle. Exfoliating (or Polishing, as we call it around here) causes a controlled injury at the most surface layer of the skin, which signals the body to send growth factors, blood and new cells to the skin. This action creates the fresh, glowing look of youthful skin and staves off aging. So next time you look in the mirror and see a reflection that’s looking a little tarnished. Remember this: all it takes is a little Polish.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/what-is-the-best-way-to-wash-your-face/,"What Is the Best Way to Wash Your Face?
You probably don’t pause and think about how important washing your face is, or how much your skin thanks you for it! When you wash your face, you’re literally washing the day away—this simple act is a chance to clear your pores from any free radicals they’ve been exposed to throughout the day, and your pores get a chance to breath and reproduce sebum, or the skin’s natural oil. When asked about the best way to wash your face, we always point back to The Lancer Method, which has three easy steps: Polish, Cleanse, and Nourish.
What Is the Best Way to Wash Your Face?
First, Polish: If you’re wearing makeup, it’s important to take it off, since makeup blocks the pores from receiving any of the benefits of our skin care products if it’s still on. Once you remove your makeup, take a small amount of your exfoliator (or Polish, as we call it around here) and massage it over your face and neck. Using an exfoliator removes dull, dead surface cells and prepares your skin for additional treatments. Our Polish has natural plant enzymes and minerals, like brown sea algae that moisturizes and stimulates collagen production, which is the protein that keeps your skin nice and tight.
Second, Cleanse: Don’t just wash away your exfoliator with only water; rather, find a cleanser that will sweep your skin clear of any exfoliation debris and provide extra pore-cleansing power. Once you’re done exfoliating, apply a small amount of cleanser to your skin and massage it over your face. Our Cleanser is enriched with Sodium PCA, which adjusts skin to its proper pH balance, which is important since makeup and the environment can dry your skin out throughout the day.
Finally, Nourish: Once you rinse off your cleanser, apply a small amount of moisturizer to your face, neck, and eye area. Nourishing your skin allows it to retain its moisture and boosts its oxygen level. This is in part to a unique compound isolated from Nasturtium flowers that increase intercellular diffusion of oxygen, which leads to healthy glowing skin.
These three steps will not only lead to healthier skin, but will promote your skin to act younger, meaning you have the extra benefit of looking younger, too! Plus, The Method is available for multiple skin types and in travel sizes, so you can care for your skin wherever you are. Let’s give three cheers for the three steps that will lead you to putting your best face forward!

Your body produces sebum, the body’s natural oil, in order to keep skin healthy; however, sebum production can go into overdrive. The cause of oily skin is actually irritation, which stimulates the nerve endings as the base of your pores, resulting in excessive oil production that can lead to clogged pores and other types of inflammation. You may ask yourself what is irritating your skin, and it can be a number of things: bar soaps, free radicals in the air, and even your hormones can cause oily skin.
So, how can you treat oily skin? One way is to look at your lifestyle and make adjustments. If you eat inflammatory foods like unsaturated fats in fast food, sugar, refined carbohydrates like white bread, or alcohol, you are causing your skin to be in an inflammatory state. Switching to raw, organic foods allows you to avoid additional hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, and other additives that are toxic and causing your skin issues.
Another way to treat oily skin is to exercise. Exercising rids your body of impurities while also increasing circulation and improving skin’s elasticity. Before your workout, be sure to remove your makeup, and make sure to shower after your workout, too. Oil and sweat can clog pores, and makeup blocks your pores from releasing sweat and toxins from your body.
Best Anti-Aging Products for Oily Skin – The Method
While these lifestyle adjustments are part of the Lancer Anti-Aging Lifestyle and are highly encouraged, you are most likely looking for anti-aging products for oily skin that will give you immediate results. The Lancer Method accelerates skin cell turnover in its three-step process of Polish, Cleanse, and Nourish that gets skin to look and feel younger within a week. The Method: Blemish Control is able to address oily skin and inflammation, like acne, because the Polish, Cleanse, and Nourish contain ingredients like lilac stem cells to absorb oil and salicylic acid to relieve clogged pores. The Method: Blemish Control helps to regulate sebum while also delivering potent anti-aging ingredients like rare grape polyphenol, a potent antioxidant that protects skin cells, and peppermint oil to boost blood flow and oxygen levels for a youthful glow.
Best Anti-Aging Products for Oily Skin – Retexturizing Treatment Cream
If you want to protect your skin from irritants like the sun or pollution in the air, we also offer an array of Advanced Treatments. Our Retexturizing Treatment Cream contains 10% glycolic acid, which will break down rough, dead skin cells while also increasing skin’s natural moisture retention, and CoQ10, an antioxidant that protects cellular DNA from free radicals while also promoting collagen production so skin improves dramatically in terms of texture and clarity.
Sunscreen is a must in any skincare routine, and you want to make sure your sunscreen does not aggravate your skin. You can protect your skin while also infusing key anti-aging ingredients with our pH-optimized fluid, the Sheer Fluid Sun Shield SPF 30. It makes for an ideal makeup primer, and will go on smooth without feeling greasy due to matching the chemistry of our Nourish.
Best Anti-Aging Products for Oily Skin -Sheer Fluid Sun Shield
Because skincare is not just about your face, we want to make sure that all of your oil concerns are accounted for by offering products that can also help with anything below the chin. You can take The Lancer Method into your shower with The Method: Body products, which also contain salicylic acid to soften keratin, the rough fibrous proteins that is abundant in dead surface skin cells, so you can open pores and stimulate the removal of toxins while encouraging circulation so skin looks rosy and fresh. Our Contour Décolleté is a lightweight serum that absorbs into skin around the neck, décolleté, and bustline in seconds. Not only does it soften the appearance of wrinkles, but the innovative formula’s acid-free exfoliating blend encourages collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid production to create smoother texture and tone.
Best Anti-Aging Products for Oily Skin – Contour Decollete
While you can look for products with anti-aging or oil control ingredients anywhere, Lancer Skincare has developed these products with both concerns in mind, and the results cannot be argued with when you notice how healthy your skin will act when using ingredients that are not irritating and provide essential antioxidants for beautiful, glowing skin. If oily skin is one of your concerns, be sure to look at our Oily Skincare page for other product recommendations. Once you use our products, you’ll discover why they are considered the best anti-aging products for oily skin.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/5-surprising-things-that-are-very-beneficial-for-your-skin/#more-667,"5 Surprising Things That Are Very Beneficial for Your Skin
With school and work back in session with no vacation plans in sight (until the holidays, perhaps), you may forget how important it is to treat yourself—and your skin. Stress from studying or work may appear in frown lines or wrinkles, and your daily perk-me-up coffee will create excess cortisol that accelerates the aging process and dehydrates your body. Besides monitoring your stress and reducing your caffeine consumption, we’ve thought of 5 surprising things that are beneficial for your skin and will potentially impact your well-being.
1. Organic Foods 
Your body gains energy and vitamins from the food you eat. Conventionally-raised foods often contain hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides that are designed to be toxic. These chemicals are not recognized by your body, and will result in an inflammatory response due to hormone imbalance. Switching to organic produce and organically-raised meat and poultry will help you avoid these toxins and allow your body to function naturally.
2. Eating Citrus Peels
In 2013, the University of Arizona monitored people who ate citrus fruits, juices, and peels weekly, and discovered that those who ate the peels had a 33% decreased risk for squamous cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer. The peels contain limonene, a compound found in the peel’s oil that offers UV-protective benefits. Peels are often used as a garnish or as zest in recipes, so the next time you’re cooking our Younger-Approved Easy Baked Salmon, try adding some lemon zest on top for extra skin benefits.
3. Vitamin C
You can get your internal dose of Vitamin C by consuming oranges, pineapples, kale, broccoli, and other foods, but what if you had the opportunity to apply Vitamin C directly to your skin? Stabilized Vitamin C, or Ascorbic Acid, acts as a collagen production co-factor and a powerful antioxidant that increases oxygen flow to the skin. We recommend using our Advanced C Radiance Cream, a water-free cream with 10% Vitamin C and retinol to help boost skin’s radiance. Because this cream is water-free, the Vitamin C remains stable and active while it boosts cell repair and reduces inflammation from external factors like sun, smog, and pollution.
4. Tepid water
Although hot water may be your answer to waking up in a hurry and creating that sauna effect in your bathroom, both the water and steam wash away natural oils and leach moisture from your skin. Hot water also aggravates sensitive skin. For bathing and washing your face, it’s best to use tepid water.
5. Yeast
Although yeast products, like bread and other baked goods, cause inflammation, it has been showing up in makeup and skincare lines. There is a species of yeast called saccharomyces cerevisiae—baker’s yeast—that can produce an anti-aging by-product when put through a biotechnological process. Yeast contains amino acids, proteins, and antioxidants that bring a youthful complexion due to its moisturizing properties. Plus, you may see yeast in your makeup, since the beauty industry is looking into more “green chemistry” to create eco-friendlier makeup.
It’s amazing how making small changes in your lifestyle can benefit your skin and well-being. We hope these 5 beneficial skincare ideas surprise you with how fresh and radiant your skin will look once you make them a part of your younger-looking skin and anti-aging lifestyle!

5 Surprising Things That Are Very Beneficial for Your Skin was last modified:  March 3rd, 2023 by Dr. Harold Lancer",5 Surprising Things That Are Very Beneficial for Your Skin,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/lancer-skincare-Beneficial-for-Your-Skin.jpg
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/how-to-get-rid-of-oily-skin/,"Though each skin type comes with its own challenges, oily skin can be particularly frustrating. Oily skin is hard to control as it is affected by hormone fluctuations, the weather, and your level of activity each day. As a result of your oily skin, you may end up with shiny skin, makeup that slides off, and enlarged or clogged pores. Despite many “mattifying” products’ claims to control and reduce oil, the best way to treat oily skin is proper skincare.

When it comes to caring for oily skin, the right skincare is vital. Although it may seem counterintuitive, you’ll want to be careful not to over-dry your skin. Even though it might seem like drying up the oil on your skin is a good idea, you need a certain amount of healthy oils in your skin to maintain skin health and moisture. Over-drying and irritating products rob your skin of beneficial oils and moisture and can cause dryness, itchiness, redness, and spur more chronic skin conditions like rosacea or chronic acne. Moreover, skin that has been stripped of necessary moisture can begin to overproduce oil, causing further oiliness and clogged pores.
It’s helpful to know what causes oily skin so that you can begin to treat it properly. Oily skin is, in part, hereditary, but it can be exacerbated by irritation that stimulates the nerve endings within the base of your pores, causing your skin to produce excess oil. This irritation can be caused by any number of factors, including stress, hormone variations, harsh cleansers or soaps, and free radicals in the environment.
So how can you begin to manage your oily skin without the negative side effects of over-drying or irritation? First, make sure you know how to polish your skin without overdoing it. Exfoliants that are overly abrasive can damage your skin, resulting in redness, irritation, more breakouts, and even hyperpigmentation. Instead, you want to polish your skin gently in order to resurface skin and clear away the dead skin cells, sebum, and bacteria that can clog your pores. Ideally, your polish will utilize both salicylic acid—a Beta Hydroxy Acid that reaches deep into pores—and a gentle, natural exfoliating ingredient to naturally polish your skin and clear away pore-clogging buildup. The Method: Polish Blemish Control uses both salicylic acid and uniform mineral crystal and sodium bicarbonate to gently polish skin and help clear your pores. The unique formulation of this exfoliator ensures that your skin is gently resurfaced for a radiant glow.
Once you’ve chosen the ideal product to polish your skin, choose a cleanser that gently removes all dirt, residual makeup, exfoliation debris, and excess oil without stripping the skin of essential hydration. No residue should be left behind as that can contribute to clogged pores and blemish-causing irritation. Your skin should not feel tight or dry after washing, nor should it necessarily be squeaky clean, as that can indicate a loss of moisture. Avoid any cleanser using alcohol, as alcohol can dehydrate the skin, leading to  irritation or excessive oil production. A cleanser containing salicylic acid, however, will help manage  excess surface oil and help keep pores clear and clean without removing hydration. The Method: Cleanse Blemish Control contains salicylic acid and tea tree oil to keep pores clear and assist in removing dead skin cells and pore-clogging sebum. After cleansing, skin should feel refreshed and look healthy and clean. Use your ideal cleanser twice daily—in the morning and at night—to help manage and normalize your oil levels. Use warm water, rather than hot, to minimize irritation while still opening pores and rinsing the cleanser away completely.
Though many skincare lines suggest toner to minimize pores and remove final traces of makeup, toners often contain drying and irritating alcohol. Overusing toner can lead to skin that is parched and more easily irritated. The drying properties of toner can also lead your skin to produce too much oil, making your skin even oilier and compounding the problem.   Dr. Lancer specifically developed The Lancer Method to be effective and not require a toner – allowing the Cleanse, when following Polish  to be highly effective.
Next, it’s important to choose a moisturizer that provides essential hydration and nourishment to your skin, without clogging your pores. Remember that dehydrated skin will only produce more oil, so despite the fact that it may seem contradictory, you need to moisturize your skin daily. If necessary, you can vary the amount of moisturizer you apply to each area of your face, depending on the oiliness in that area. Choose a moisturizer that is lightweight, rather than a highly emollient cream that may be too heavy for oily skin. The right moisturizer should sink into your skin and provide moisture without leaving your skin greasy. The Method: Nourish Blemish Control is an ultra-light moisturizer that provides vital hydration and still fights acne. This product contains salicylic acid and lilac stem cells to help manage oil production for clear pores , while nasturtium flower extract provides a healthy glow for radiant-looking skin. Additionally, a powerful antioxidant—rare grape polyphenol, õ-viniferin—helps protect your skin from the aging effects of the environment.
Even oily skin needs sunscreen, but many sunscreens are heavy, thick, and can clog pores. Still, you need to protect your skin, and it is recommended that a sunscreen with a broad spectrum SPF of 30 be used. In order to avoid aggravating oily skin, look for lightweight sunscreens that absorb completely and do not leave a greasy film on the skin.  Sheer Fluid Sun Shield Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen is a weightless and fresh feeling sunscreen that also works as a makeup primer. The broad spectrum SPF protects your skin from damaging UV rays, while sunflower sprout and chamomile extracts soothe your skin and help provide radiance without oiliness.
After you’ve identified your ideal skincare regimen and you begin to manage your skin, you may find that your skin still has a bit of a sheen at the end of the day. If so, you can use additional products to help manage that excess oil. Oil-blotting papers are an ideal way to manage oiliness without adding any additional products to your routine and risking further drying or irritation. Oil-blotting papers simply absorb the oil on the surface of your skin, so you can toss it in the trash. Just press the paper lightly onto oily areas for 10 to 20 seconds, then remove and discard.
You’ll also want to make sure you wear makeup that is non-comedogenic and isn’t too heavy. Anything heavy, oily, greasy, or waxy runs the risk of clogging your pores and adding to the oil on your skin. If possible, skip heavier foundations that may have emollient ingredients and, instead, opt for powder mineral makeup or light mousse formulas. Regardless of whichever makeup you decide on using, check to make sure the formula won’t clog pores and be diligent about removing your makeup at night. If you wear waterproof or long-wear formulas, try using gentle Makeup Removing Wipes before The Lancer Method to remove as much makeup as possible and allow your skincare to work properly on your oily skin.
In addition to skincare, keep in mind that your lifestyle can have an impact on your skin as well. Eating as clean as you can—plenty of organic fruits and vegetables and other healthy, whole foods—can also help ensure healthy skin. Avoid fast food, white bread, and non-organic animal products that may include additional hormones, antibiotics, pesticides and other additives that can adversely affect your skin. Drinking plenty of water will keep your skin hydrated and help your body flush toxins, too.
Exercise is another way to rid your body of toxins and impurities, as well as encouraging increased circulation in your skin. Be aware, however, that exercising can temporarily increase oil production. Be sure to remove your makeup before exercising to ensure that oil and sweat don’t get trapped beneath your makeup, clogging pores and causing blemishes. Shower promptly after exercise as well to ensure that you wash away all the excess oil and impurities in your sweat that can clog pores once reabsorbed into the skin.
Keep an eye on when your skin seems oiliest and vary your skincare routine accordingly. Many people find that their skin is much oilier in the summer than in the winter. This may mean that you’ll need more moisture and less oil-managing salicylic acid in the winter months. Hormones can also affect your skin’s oil production, as can your workout routine. Be aware of when your skin is oiliest, and when it’s not, so that you can adjust your skincare regimen as needed and avoid over-drying or irritating your skin.
If you’ve followed our advice and still can’t find relief for your oily skin, seek help from an experienced dermatologist like Dr. Harold Lancer. Laser treatments and chemical peels can be used to treat oily skin, but only a dermatologist can determine what will help your skin without irritating it more and aggravating further oil production.
Ultimately, oily skin can be a blessing as long as you maintain it properly and keep the oil under control. With proper care, the extra moisture in your skin can result in skin that looks younger longer. Be attentive to your oily skin with the right skincare, treatments, and proper maintenance, and you’ll be able to fend off breakouts and enjoy skin that is supple, soft, and balanced.

You may appear to have one type of skin, but your skin may react in surprising ways because of your heritage.
Know Your History.

Understanding your ancestry can help you understand your skin and address any skin problems. Your visible pigmentation isn’t necessarily reflective of how your skin will behave.
Understand the Lancer Ethnicity Scale (LES), which accounts for five different skin types based on geography and heredity. Each skin type has its own challenges and benefits.

LES I is extremely fair skin that burns quickly and tends toward sensitivity. Your ancestors are:

Celtic
Nordic
Northern European


LES II is fair skin that does not burn quickly, but still wrinkles and sags and can scar easily. Your ancestors are:

Central, Eastern, or Northern European


LES III is golden skin, possibly with olive undertones, that can scar easily or become easily inflamed. Your ancestors are:

European Jews
Native American and Inuit
Southern European and Mediterranean


LES IV is olive or brown skin that can become easily inflamed and can tend toward acne. Your ancestors are:

Sephardic Jews
Central and South American Indian
Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese
Filipino and Polynesian
Southern European and Mediterranean


LES V is black skin that can react to irritation with discoloration or texture changes. Your ancestors are:

Central, East, and West African
Eritrean and Ethiopian
North African and Middle East Arabic




To find your LES skin type, add up the four numbers that correspond to your grandparents’ ethnicities on your maternal and paternal sides. Divide that total number by four to find your LED score.
A higher LES score means a higher risk with treatments. No matter what, there is always risk with any treatment that requires healing. A higher LES score comes with a higher risk of adverse reactions to resurfacing treatments.
Communicate with your dermatologist so they’re aware of your ancestral history. They’ll be better able to anticipate how skincare or treatments may affect your skin. Research into your family history can reveal more about your skin than you’d think.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/60s-skin-care-guide/,"Skincare in Your 60s: The Best Products for the Golden Years
Women in their 60s face a variety of skin challenges. According to the US National Library of Medicine, the right vitamins, diet, and sun protection play a big role in skin health and appearance. However, normal hormonal and physiological changes subdue sweat and oil gland functionality, slow the cell regeneration cycle, and thin the epidermis, creating wrinkles, a dull complexion, and a loss of elasticity. As we age, those changes—most commonly dryness and noticeable wrinkles—become pronounced.

For visible results without the risk or recovery time of surgical intervention, the extensive line of cutting-edge Lancer products and non-invasive treatments will make all the difference. “The idea that people reach this age, throw in the towel, and get a facelift—that’s passé,” states Dr. Lancer in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar magazine. He firmly believes that dramatic results—even an appearance of a decade or two younger—is fully possible without surgery, thanks to advancements in modern dermatology and the incredible products he has at his disposal. “A 60-year-old cosmetic virgin can look like she is in her late 40s without surgery; it’s just a more gradual process.”
Dr. Lancer recognizes that women in their 60s often particularly worry about specific problem areas—namely, the eyes, neck, and chest. As part of his advanced treatments, Dr. Lancer offers products and procedures to target the areas of skin that age first and cause his clients the most concern.
 
The delicate eye area consists of a very thin skin layer and, as such, is one of the first locations to dry and wrinkle. One of the most popular products,  Eye Contour Lifting Cream, features MDCP complex and Diamond powder to efficiently reduce the appearance of crow’s feet, dark circles, and puffiness.
To remedy chronically dry skin, Intensive Night Treatment with Hylaplex®—a cross-linked form of hyaluronic acid with peptides and phytocompounds, and the essential fatty acids and antioxidants from marula oil—works to plump skin’s appearance and provide long-lasting moisture, achieving a noticeable reduction of lines and wrinkles.
And for truly decadent improvement, the premium Lift Serum Intense combines Cassava Root Extract, an exclusive stem cell complex derived from sea plant and grape stem cells, and pure 24K gold (which maintains the skin’s natural electromagnetic field) to deliver firming and lifting effects for dramatically smoother and younger-looking skin.
Dr. Lancer also specializes in radio frequency treatments, which work to simultaneously brighten and firm the skin.  He finds that this is a particularly successful method to remedy loose or sagging skin, and typically recommends three monthly applications of Venus Viva, or the EndyMed 3 Deep for a deeper delivery of radio frequency energy.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/24-hours-dr-lancer/,"Our Beverly Hills dermatologist to the stars shares a typical day at the office


4:30 A.M.
Wherever I am, no matter where in the world, I wake up naturally at 4:30am local time, and never need an alarm. It’s a blessing but also a curse, especially when I’m on vacation with my family. My dog, Gracie Marie, sleeps on my side and burrows underneath a giant blanket, so I’ll pet her then get out of bed and ready for my day. I always use my Lancer Method before leaving for the office, and don’t need much time to get ready.

5:10 A.M.
I arrive at my office and will usually see a couple paparazzi standing outside my building. They tend to get there early to prepare themselves for any celebrity sightings.

5:15 A.M.
Breakfast at Lancer Skincare Clinic in Beverly Hills – I make breakfast in the office kitchen. I choose meals that will give me energy to start the day. I love kale salads with white balsamic vinegar and ground organic turkey breast, but will also make wild poached salmon to switch things up. I eat at my desk and get in an hour’s worth of reading, researching, and writing before my day gets going.

6:30 A.M.
During the week, I usually have press interviews regarding my skincare line or new procedures, so I prefer to reserve this early window for these types of calls, rather than interrupt time with my patients. Just today I had a phone interview with GQ on the importance of using sunscreen and then spoke with Harper’s Bazaar about the Silhouette Instalift.

7:30 A.M.
I see around fifty patients a day, starting at 7:30 am. On my schedule for today are two Silhouette Instalift procedures, Botox, a cystic acne treatment, scar removal using one of our state-of-the-art lasers, and a skin cancer removal on a patient’s nose. No two patients have the same exact concerns, so every day is very different, which is one of the reasons why I love what I do.

8:00 A.M. – 12:30 P.M.
There are no other doctors at my practice, so I see every patient no matter how small the visit. I’ll examine the skin and have a nurse take pictures if the patient is coming in with a new skin-related concern. Sometimes there isn’t an issue, just an interest in starting a better skincare routine. I introduce every patient to The Lancer Method, a three-step skincare routine that effectively exfoliates, cleanses and hydrates the skin, as it works for all skin types.

12:30 P.M.
I have little, if any, downtime, but at 12:30, I sneak a peek into the kitchen to see my team, who eats lunch together every day. I’ll try to order from a restaurant they like but I’m all about eating healthy, so typically avoid takeout. Occasionally, I’ll splurge on Sprinkles Cupcakes for special occasions or if it’s someone’s birthday.

1:00 P.M.
I start seeing patients again after lunch. While they come from a variety of professional backgrounds, many are connected to the entertainment industry or the political arena, and often want discretion around their visits. We have our ways of getting these clients in and out without anyone noticing. It all depends on the person, but there are certain patients of mine who don’t mind sitting in the waiting room and signing the occasional autograph.

4:15 P.M.
Without fail, I go to Equinox in Beverly Hills after my workday ends, and spend time on the Stairmaster and in the sauna to decompress. It’s my favorite place to go after work, and the routine keeps me feeling young, energized and in shape.

6:00 P.M
I call my eldest daughter, Alexis, to catch up, on my way home. She’s lived in New York City for ten years and loves the lifestyle there. I’ll also call my wife, Dani, to let her know I’m on my way home.

7:00 P.M.
If it’s a weekday, I’m home having dinner with my wife and youngest daughter, Blair, who just moved back home. It’s been wonderful having her energy in the home again these past couple months. I love family time, and am happiest when my two daughters are around.

9:00 P.M.
Lancer Skincare Clinic in Beverly Hills After dinner, it’s not unusual for me to come into the office for an emergency visit. A VIP may be flying in from London or a celebrity patient may only be in town for one night and needs to be seen. I make sure to always be there for my patients, no matter what time it is, since their schedules can be so unpredictable. I even have a mini suite within my office, which has a bed and a private bathroom so I’m able to catch some rest if needed.

11:00 P.M.
Sleeping is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, and with my early mornings, it’s important to get some shut-eye.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/50s-skin-care-guide/,"Best Skincare Regimen for 50 Year Olds
Skincare for women over 50 can be challenging, especially if hormone fluctuations cause added stress. As you reach menopause, testosterone increases and estrogen decreases. You may experience a recurrence of acne, a dull or mottled complexion, and you might notice the appearance of dark spots from sun damage right alongside crow’s feet and other fine lines and wrinkles. This deterioration might feel frustratingly inevitable, but with a skincare regimen that uses the highest quality products, you can prevent and reverse many signs of aging.

Nourishing your skin with a diet rich in antioxidants and the nutrients it needs to function best is just one of the steps you can take toward a healthy complexion. Another critical step is the removal of dead skin and excess sebum, and the subsequent stimulation of fresh cellular regeneration. The Lancer Method 3-step system gently exfoliates dead skin cells, dirt, and debris away. Then, it cleanses and nourishes your skin with potent antioxidants, cushioning your healthy cells in moisture and improving the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.
While healthy, supple skin is the overall skincare goal, different areas of the body require particular consideration. Due to a decrease in collagen, 50-year-old skin tends to lose its natural plumpness. This dramatically increases the length and depth of wrinkles and fine lines. This becomes noticeable as the skin on your throat and chest loses its full, firm appearance as you age. Developed for both immediate and long-term results, Dr. Lancer’s Contour Décolleté helps to plump skin with an acid-free exfoliating blend and a 5-peptide liposomal system, while active amino acids from marine cone snail venom help reduce visible signs of aging around the neck, chest, and décolletage.
The National Institute of Health’s Medline Plus publication points out that dryness is common in women over 50, thanks to the functional limitation of sweat and oil glands. To help skin maintain its natural hydration and improve the appearance of dark spots and fine lines, use the Lancer Retexturizing Treatment. Not only does it pack a powerful phospholipid complex, but it contains glycolic acid, which helps to exfoliate rough, dead surface skin cells so that other anti-aging products can be absorbed faster, deeper, and more effectively.
For your go-to everyday moisturizer and brightening tool, Dani Glowing Skin Perfector is an innovative, illuminating skin finisher and treatment that revitalizes and perfects all skin tones in one simple step. This lightweight cream harnesses the incredible properties of Asian botanicals to help firm aging skin, diffuse imperfections, and blur the appearance of pores for a smoother, visibly lifted effect. Micro-fine, light-catching mineral highlighters delicately enhance your skin’s natural radiance, creating a lit-from-within glow and a distinctively younger look.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/40s-skin-care-guide/,"Dr. Lancer’s Skincare Regimen for 40-Somethings
In your 40s, hormonal fluctuations can cause recurrent adult acne, your skin may appear dull or sallow, and fine lines and wrinkles may have made a visible appearance. Dr. Lancer explains, “Biologically speaking, 25 is the age when your body’s cell replacement system comes to a screeching halt, but it’s not till your 40s that it really starts to show.” With the right skincare regimen, however, you can work with your skin to maintain—or regain—a firm and glowing complexion. Skincare after 40 continues to be about protection and prevention, while also ensuring that your skin receives the rejuvenation and essential antioxidants it needs to look its healthiest.

You’ve heard this unfortunate truth before: Sun damage causes wrinkles, ages your skin, and can make you look older than you are. Excessive, unprotected exposure to the sun causes skin to become dry and leathery. And while you may not be the type who sunbathed in your youth, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has proven that your skin can sustain damage in just 15 minutes of exposure. It’s never too late to start taking better care of the biggest organ you have. With Sheer Fluid Sun Shield SPF 30, you can prevent further damage and enjoy weightless, anti-aging moisturizing at the same time.
The US National Library of Medicine reports that, as you age, you sweat less (decreasing the process that allows the body to expel grit and grime naturally accumulated inside pores), hormonal changes diminish your skin’s hydration, and the epidermis thins, making the skin more easily damaged. These changes occur not only facially, but all over the body. The Lancer Method: Body is a 3-step system of polishing the skin with finely milled pure quartz crystals, cleansing with non-stripping agents, and nourishing the skin with marula oil, kigelia extract, and Kalahari melon seed extract to enable your skin to remain smooth, clean, and hydrated.
40 is the new 30, and there is no reason your skin has to say otherwise. Younger Pure Youth Serum with Dr. Lancer’s proprietary retinoid blend, MIMIXYL™, is a luxurious, high-performance anti-aging serum that dramatically resurfaces the skin, putting glycolic acid—Dr. Lancer’s favorite for evening out tone and texture—to work, activating the regeneration of collagen and new cells and significantly improving tone and elasticity.
For clinic-quality treatment in the comfort of your own home, choose what Dr. Lancer uses in his Red Carpet Flash Facial—the Lift and Plump Sheet Masks. These highly-concentrated masks contain apple stem cell compounds and Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, providing a tighter and more lifted appearance, while rose water, Centella Asiatica Extract, and sodium hyaluronate quench the skin with natural humectants, increasing hydration and suppleness.
The right skincare in your 40s can give you the beauty and confidence you deserve. Experience Lancer Skincare, the best skincare regimen for 40-year-olds, and uncover your healthier, more youthful complexion.

In your 30s, your skin might appear duller than it once did, and you may notice fine lines around your lips, forehead, or eyes. The cell cycle naturally slows in your late 20s, and the effects of that decline slowly begin to appear. Your skincare routine should be both preventative and active, treating existing problems and protecting against any new ones. While you may have already developed good skin maintenance habits in your 20s, and you are still young, your skin will become less efficient in your 30s. Now is the time to shift to a skincare routine that will stimulate your skin to continue cellular regeneration.

To combat these small signs of aging and to keep your skin looking fresh, Dr. Lancer recommends The Lancer Method, a 3-step system that gently polishes dead skin cells away, utilizing finely milled quartz crystals to smooth the surface of your skin so that the pH-balanced cleanser is optimally effective and the moisturizer can deliver nourishing anti-aging nutrients, including nasturtium flower extract and red grape antioxidants, to your skin.
One of the most missed opportunities in one’s anti-aging skincare routine is not putting on sunscreen. Though the wisdom of sunscreen is common knowledge, many people do not include this in their daily routine due to the unpleasant heavy or greasy feeling that many sunscreens create or because sunscreen may interfere with makeup application. Fortunately, Dr. Lancer’s weightless Sheer Fluid Sun Shield SPF 30 serves as both makeup primer and protection from the sun, making it ideal to incorporate into your daily routine.
Dr. Lancer recognizes that truly powerful skincare focuses on nourishment inside and out. A diet full of nutrient-rich foods is important for your overall health and appearance. But, despite your best health efforts, your skin may already show dullness, discoloration, or enlarged pores. When you are looking for show-stopping results, Dr. Lancer’s moisturizing Retexturizing Treatment, with 10% glycolic acid, provides dramatic exfoliation to reveal bright new skin and significantly smoother texture. To take your skin to the next level, add the silky Advanced C Radiance Treatment, formulated to brighten skin tone and reduce the appearance of UV damage with retinol and 10% vitamin C.

The thinnest skin on the face is near the eyes and lips, which means that these places are most susceptible to showing signs of aging sooner than other areas of your body. Dr. Lancer’s Eye Contour Lifting Cream with Diamond Powder and Volume Enhancing Lip Serum effectively treat signs of aging in these areas with powerful and targeted formulas.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/20s-skin-care/,"Dr. Lancer’s Skin Care Regimen for 20-Somethings: Focus on Prevention
For those in their 20s, Dr. Lancer recommends a skincare regimen with a strong emphasis on prevention. The Skin Cancer Foundation reports that 23% of “lifetime exposure” (sun damage) occurs before a person is 18 and another 46% occurs between 19-40 years of age. So, now is the time to cultivate good skin health habits and to find the right care regimen for you.

Skincare should be simple, fast, preventative, and, most of all, effective. During your 20s, your primary skincare concerns may be managing acne or occasional breakouts, while simultaneously trying to prevent your mother’s wrinkles from forming on your forehead. While genetics, diet, medications, makeup, stress, and exercise all play a role in the condition of your skin, a premium skincare regimen can manage your breakouts and prevent signs of aging at the same time.
For this dual skin concern, Dr. Lancer recommends The Lancer Method: Blemish Control products. The Lancer Method: Blemish Control is a daily 3-step system that offers polishing, cleansing, and nourishing to achieve and maintain your skin’s healthy glow. To make sure that your young, beautiful skin stays protected, complete the regimen—and reapply often—with Lancer Sheer Fluid Sun Shield SPF 30.
Sun damage can cause skin cancer, wrinkles, age spots, and overall aging to the appearance and health of your skin. While practical behaviors—like wearing a hat to shade your face—are excellent, complete avoidance of the sun is unrealistic. And, it can be hard to remember a cloudy day can cause just as much damage as a bright, sunny one. Whether you are enjoying an afternoon outside with friends or simply running errands around town, Lancer Sheer Fluid Sun Shield SPF 30 gives you weightless, non-greasy, UVA/UVB protection. It’s also a phenomenal makeup primer, encouraging flawless application of your favorite foundation.
The surest way to show the world the most enchanting version of yourself is by making sure your skin is even, bright, and healthy. The same goes for your lips. When you want to define lip contours, smooth out the appearance of vertical lip lines, and provide hydration for visible fullness and a glossy sheen, Dr. Lancer recommends his Volume Enhancing Lip Serum, to rejuvenate your lips and create a plump, lush smile.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/ultimate-guide-younger-skin/,"There are two types of aging: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic aging is the natural aging process, where our genetics determine when our skin becomes thinner and drier, loses some of its youthful fullness, or get visible lines on our face. Extrinsic aging, however, is based on one’s environment and lifestyle choices, and can lead to early signs of aging. While you may not be able to control your genetics or your natural environment, you can control your skin’s appearance and prevent further signs of aging.
Dr. Lancer’s anti-aging program and practice are rooted in the belief in restoration instead of alteration.
The Lancer Method was developed by studying the skin’s regenerative process for over 30 years, resulting in a non-invasive daily skincare routine that will maintain youthfulness or reverse first or advanced signs of aging. Here, you will learn what causes aging, what these causes look like on your skin, and how to properly rejuvenate the skin from head to toe.
Causes
When we are young, our skin renews itself at a cellular level in a continuous 28-day cycle. This process of creating new cells and sloughing off old ones gradually slows down as we get older, leading to common signs of aging. The reproduction of skin cells is affected by the intrinsic aging system. As you get older, your body produces different enzymes that contribute to the breakdown of collagen and elastic tissue, the protein that gives skin that it’s plump bounce. This extracellular matrix is what provides skin’s structure, but it eventually diminishes as a part of the aging process.
Although everyone eventually experiences the common first signs of aging—fine lines, enlarged pores, changes in skin’s texture and appearance —their appearance occurs at different rates in different people. Genetics play a major factor in how our individual bodies age, but the onset and severity of the signs of aging is hugely impacted by extrinsic aging factors, lifestyle and environment.
Here are a few examples:

Sun Damage
One of the primary causes of advanced aging is too much time spent in the sun without proper protection. Protecting the eyes with sunglasses, wearing a hat to protect the face from light and generally staying in the shade are all important facets of an anti-aging lifestyle.
Ultraviolet (UV) light counteracts protective antioxidants, peptides, and other ingredients in your anti-aging skincare regimen.  Protecting skin is important if you want to keep skin looking smooth and youthful.
The pigment melanin provides some protection against the sun, and can be seen in our skin when we tan due to the increased production of melanin. While those with darker complexions have more melanin and will not burn as quickly, they are still at risk for hyperpigmentation, skin cancer and an overall aged appearance.
While you may focus on your face as the tell-tale for first signs of aging, advanced signs of aging are a possibility when it comes to the delicate skin below your jawline, most notably your neck and décolletage. These areas are exposed to just as many damaging UV rays as the face, and at an increased risk for signs of aging. For this reason the skin of the neck and décolleté becomes lined and saggy around the throat, collarbone, and cleavage.

Caffeine Intake
When used as a topical ingredient, caffeine is an antioxidant that can reduce wrinkles, like crow’s feet; however, excessive caffeine consumption in your daily diet is drying and damaging to your skin.
Drinking caffeine or highly caffeinated beverages, like soda or coffee, launches your body into a stressed-out state.
When in a stressed-out state, skin becomes more reactive and sensitive, leading towards acne flare-ups, dryness, and the breakdown of collagen and elastin. Stress also interrupts the healing process of skin contributing to a dull, sallow complexion.

Smoking, Drinking, Partying
Many people engage in social drinking, the occasional cigarette, and other indulgences without realizing the damage it can do to skin. The truth is, avoiding these behaviors entirely is the best thing you can possibly do if you are serious about caring for your skin. Here are some things to keep in mind to ensure that you’ll look your best for years to come:
Smoking deters overall health, and is very damaging for your skin even if you aren’t smoking but find yourself around cigarettes. Secondhand smoke triggers biochemical changes that lead to signs of advanced aging.
People who routinely smoke will notice a loss of firmness in the skin due to the depletion of vitamin C in the body, which is one of the key antioxidants helping to keep skin plump and moist.
The result in terms of physical appearance due to this loss of firmness is wrinkled, leathery skin with a yellow tinge.
Drinking alcoholic beverages is something to also be cautious of in terms of how it affects your skin. When you drink liquor, small blood vessels in your epidermis dilate, resulting in a flushed appearance. This “glow” is not the healthy glow you should have, and instead can lead to permanent ruddiness and broken capillaries.
Alcohol dehydrates the body, which can cause skin to look scaly and taut with superficial lines and premature signs of aging due to low levels of water and oxygen in body.
While a flushed appearance may not affect your physical appearance, signs of dehydration do become more prevalent with age and can be dangerous to overall health. It is important to regulate hydration levels to avoid skin and health problems over time.
Excessive partying is the potential culmination of both of the aforementioned activities, and the two lifestyle choices below. While you may indulge in the atmosphere of drinking, eating food that may be higher in carbohydrates, fat, and sugar than you’re used to, or stay out later than you normally do, remember that these lifestyle choices will affect how your skin looks and feels for days and potentially weeks to follow.
Remember to monitor your activities whenever you can, as moderating these behaviors will help to prevent early signs of aging or advanced aging.

Sleep
Sleep gives your body time to repair and rebalance itself. Our Bodies cycle back and forth between deep, restorative sleep and dreaming, a stage known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Each cycle lasts around 90 minutes and repeats throughout the night. While both cycles are important for overall health, the most damaging effects of sleep deprivation are from insufficient REM sleep.
The skin cell regenerative process does most of its work while you sleep, and thus is less effective when our bodies are deprived of sleep. Skin experiences a loss in firmness due to reduced collagen production when we do not get adequate sleep, caused by inflammation in the complexion. When inflammation is a continuous factor in skin’s health, acne breakouts and increased sensitivity become common occurrences.
During sleep, hydration in our skin rebalances, and without adequate sleep, inflammation breaks down hyaluronic acid, skin’s natural source of moisture. This loss of hyaluronic acid weakens the skin’s barrier function, leading trans-epidermal water loss, where skin appears dry and dull.
Without proper hydration, cell and tissue repair and growth hormones cannot be adequately stimulated, resulting in common signs of aging.
The importance of sleep does not simply amount to how many hours you get, but the position in which you sleep. Sleeping on your stomach presses your face into the pillow, resulting in the creation of fine lines and creases, while sleeping on your side may cause the chest and cleavage areas to also crease, causing fine lines and wrinkles over time. Sleeping on your back is best for preventing signs of aging.

Diet
A diet focused on skin health should contain as many fresh and whole foods as possible. Junk food is predominantly fatty, greasy, and salty; made with saturated fats, trans-fats, and hydrogenated oil all of which are detrimental to our overall health, and create free radicals which can age our skin and body from the inside out. Simple carbohydrates like bread, rice, pasta, and pastries are converted to sugar when digested. High sugar levels triggers glycation in the skin, the process by which sugar molecules come into contact with collagen and cause an immediate chemical reaction in the form of AGEs, which damage the protein fibers of collagen and elastin and signal inflammatory processes in skin cells.
Glycation results in wrinkling, loss of firmness, stiffness, and accelerated aging.
Weight cycling or yo-yo dieting is also important to avoid for the health of your body and skin. When weight continuously fluctuates, our skin is repeatedly stretched resulting in potentially saggy skin. Yo-yo dieting, also throws hormones out of balance, resulting in an increased production in cortisol, which is highly damaging to our bodies and our complexions.

SKINCARE SOLUTIONS
The causes of aging are primarily extrinsic, so changing your daily habits to support an anti-aging lifestyle will help prevent the early onset of the common signs of aging. Now that you know how to help prevent wrinkles, fine lines and dull skin, what should you do about signs that are already visible? Read on to find out what Lancer Skincare products can help you revive your skin for a more youthful glow:
The Lancer Method
The Lancer Method is a 3-step anti-aging skin care system which helps support the skin’s natural cycle of cell renewal to leave skin smooth, healthy and glowing. The Method is based on three essential steps: Polish, Cleanse and Nourish. Each product in the three steps relies on Interlocking Chemistry to boost the effectiveness of the other products. By encouraging cell renewal, gently cleansing without stripping the skin and providing intense hydration, The Lancer Method helps to skin to “act younger.”
The Method is available in formulations for three skin types:  Normal, Blemish Prone and Sensitive. All three versions of The Method help to treat and prevent common signs of aging; each version is made with exceptional ingredients to suit individual skin concerns.




Polish is the first step of The Lancer Method. The Method: Polish works by exfoliating the epidermis with quartz and sodium bicarbonate crystals that are uniform in size and shape. These finely grained crystals deeply clean pores and polish away any surface debris. Depending on the line you choose, The Method: Polish also contains ingredients like pumpkin and pomegranate extracts or salicylic acid to additionally help remove dead skin cells.
 



The second step in The Method, Cleanse, is a gentle, lightly-foaming cleanser that removes daily impurities, and any lifted debris from polishing. This important second step ensures that skin is truly clean and prepared to receive anti-aging treatments.
 



The Method: Nourish moisturizer contains a unique blend of hexapeptides, Nasturtium Flower Extract and a blend of potent anti-aging ingredients to give skin a healthy, youthful glow.



Whether you’re dealing with the first signs of aging or advanced wrinkles, you will notice a difference when you begin using The Lancer Method as your primary skincare regimen.
Sheer Fluid Sun Shield SPF 30: To protect yourself from UV rays and the sun damage they cause, daily use of sunscreen is a must. Lancer Skincare Sheer Fluid Sun Shield SPF 30 is a weightless sunscreen that protects skin from UVA/UVB rays while delivering a payload of hydrating, anti-aging ingredients. Sheer Fluid Sun Shield is an ideal primer to ensure you receive complete sun protection that feels both hydrating and weightless. Remember that just because a sunscreen has a very high SPF doesn’t mean that you don’t need to reapply throughout the day; there is a marginal difference between SPF 100 and SPF 30.  With Sheer Fluid Sun Shield you can feel secure that you are not only choosing a sunscreen that can fully protect you from the sun, but also the best sunscreen to combat signs of aging.
Eye Contour Lifting Cream: Eyes are especially susceptible to signs of aging due to the very delicate and thin skin of the area. Eye Contour Lifting Cream was formulated to help treat multiple signs of aging, like dark circles, puffiness, and the appearance of fine lines. As mentioned earlier, caffeine can be used as a topical treatment, and our ultra-rich eye cream contains caffeine liposomes that help to reduce the appearance of fine lines and puffiness. Palmitoyl oligopeptide and hexapeptide help to combat signs of aging, while brown algae extract increases moisture content so eyes look hydrated and refreshed.
Younger: Pure Youth Serum: A luxurious, high-performance anti-aging serum formulated with Mimixyl, Dr. Lancer’s proprietary retinoid blend.  This vibrant treatment dramatically resurfaces skin improving the appearance of tone and elasticity, while helping wrinkles look less numerous and less deep.  Skin radiates a youthful vitality.   From Dr. Lancer, “The retinoids provided in this product offer powerful results with none of the drawbacks associated with retinoid use.  It is my most advanced anti-aging treatment thus far and the perfect companion product for its namesake book Younger: The Breakthrough Anti-Aging Method for Radiant Skin.”
Lift Serum Intense: Lift Serum Intense is the answer to aged skin that needs smoothing, lifting. This elegant serum uses pure 24K gold and Stem Cell Complex, an exclusive plant stem cell compound, to deliver firming and lifting effects. Electromagnetically-neutral gold and moisture-holding molecules support skin’s natural cycle for skin that looks smoother, firmer and younger. This acid-free product serum supplements any anti-aging.
Contour Décolleté:  Since the delicate skin on the neck and chest has less collagen than other areas of the body, it is important to treat early in order to prevent signs of advanced aging. Dr. Lancer formulated Contour Décolleté, an innovative firming concentrate, to quickly absorb into skin, plumping and smoothing the appearance of wrinkles, and improving skin tone and texture over time. Contour Décolleté’s unique formula includes marine cone snail venom, which is a bio-identical peptide that reduces the appearance of fine lines and chest wrinkles, and a liposomal delivery system of five peptides to mimic skin’s natural growth factors, creating a youth-building effect in the skin.
Advanced C Radiance Cream: Vitamin C is abundant in the skin, and when vitamin C is used in concentrations of 5% or higher, it works to reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation. Additionally, vitamin C helps to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Because the Advanced C Radiance Cream is a water-free formulation, the vitamin C remains stable and active, allowing your skin to receive maximum therapeutic benefits.
Intensive Night Treatment: An ultra-hydrating cream, Intensive Night Treatment contains Hylaplex®, a cross-linked form of hyaluronic acid with anti-aging peptides which helps skin look softer, smoother, and younger. Marula oil helps to nourish skin with essential fatty acids and antioxidants. As part of the Advanced Treatment line, Intensive Night Treatment dramatically increase the skin’s ability to retain moisture while treating the skin with essential fatty acids and antioxidants.
If you want to create the ultimate anti-aging skincare regimen, you need to be aware of the causes for the first signs of aging. Dr. Lancer has studied how intrinsic and extrinsic aging affects the skin, and formulated his anti-aging products with this knowledge. Lancer Skincare combines modern science and proven anti-aging ingredients with a non-invasive approach to radiance. Skin will look and feel younger thanks to the Lancer Method and the Lancer Skincare Advanced Treatments.
By adjusting your lifestyle and consistently following an anti-aging regimen, you’ll have younger-looking skin for years to come.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/expect-thermiva-picoway-treatments/,"Many women are looking for additional ways to improve the look of the skin all over their bodies. While excellent skincare is a great first step, there are other things to consider. When it comes to skin and tissue damage, as well as permanent marks like tattoos, clients often need to go beyond skincare to see results. Increasingly, patients are seeking procedures to treat issues that may be less conventional, but ultimately make a big difference in how they feel about themselves and how they look.

PicoWay is one such treatment, sought by patients looking to remove tattoos and even out skin pigmentation or irregularities. This laser treatment can also be helpful in treating some signs of aging. Compared to other laser treatments with similar purposes, patients find that PicoWay is fast and effective, requiring minimal downtime. Because this treatment is suitable for all skin types and works for a variety of different purposes, PicoWay is growing in popularity.
Tattoo removal used to be painful. The heat energy emitted by the traditional lasers, used to shatter tattoo ink within the skin, caused discomfort to patients, making tattoo removal somewhat daunting. However, PicoWay is the quickest, most effective dual wavelength laser available to the medical community. This treatment causes minimal discomfort because the ultra-fast laser transfers energy into the skin’s tissue quickly, so the heat emitted by the laser is minimal, making it much more comfortable for patients.
PicoWay uses picosecond laser technology to treat multi-colored tattoos on a variety of different skin types. With most lasers, darker skin tones are more difficult to treat as darker skin absorbs too much energy from the laser. This can weaken results and cause unpleasant side effects. PicoWay, on the other hand, is better at selectively treating specific areas, so it’s more effective for patients of all skin tones.
PicoWay delivers incredibly fast and concentrated laser pulses—measured in picoseconds, or trillionths of a second—to break up the ink particles in the skin. And, because the pulses are so quick, it is a fast, comfortable treatment that can often be completed during your lunch break, with very little downtime afterward.
In addition, the lasers trigger the body’s natural healing process, causing beneficial inflammation that provides anti-aging benefits. Patients who come in to even out hyperpigmentation may also enjoy the anti-aging benefits that come with PicoWay. Even when PicoWay is administered on facial skin, full healing is achieved within one week, so you’ll be able to see the full results quickly.
Another treatment clients have recently sought out is Thermiva, a thermal energy treatment for vaginal restoration. This treatment is designed for patients who want to restore their vulvovaginal well being and youthfulness. Thermiva can also be successfully used for treating urinary incontinence or atrophic vulvovaginitis—a lack of vaginal lubrication. Many of these issues are a result of age, but patients who have had children are especially likely to experience a number of excellent results from this procedure.
For patients experiencing vaginal laxity or who are displeased with the aesthetic appearance of their external genitalia, Thermiva can be used for tightening of the vaginal cavity, as well as the external labia and vulva. Applications of this minimally invasive electrocoagulation use radiofrequency energy to gently heat tissue and help restore tone to the vaginal anatomy.
For patients interested in treating urinary incontinence, the Thermiva treatment helps to restore tone to the muscle tissue surrounding the urethra. In addition, patients struggling with atrophic vulvovaginitis will benefit from Thermiva as it stimulates an improvement in vaginal lubrication, making intimacy more comfortable and reducing the likelihood of infections.
While Thermiva treatment may seem intimidating, they are both painless and fast. Patients will find these treatments are the same, or less intrusive, than a regular gynecological exam. The Thermiva device is about the size of an index finger and the heat generated by the Thermiva is never uncomfortably hot. Treatments last about 30 minutes, and the procedure is painless and non-surgical. Thermiva is always administered by highly trained professionals.
Because there is no damage to any of the tissue with Thermiva, there is no downtime. Patients are able to resume all regular activities the same day they receive the treatment. Patients looking for improved aesthetic appearance, improved tone of the vaginal anatomy, and improved sexual function are ideal candidates for the benefits of Thermiva.
While these treatments may not be the first that come to mind when you think of laser treatments, they are increasing in popularity, and for good reason. Patients who try PicoWay and Thermiva are generally quite pleased with the results. The benefits resulting from these procedures often go beyond their original intent, providing improvements in addition to the intended results.
Don’t hesitate to visit a dermatology office experienced in administering these procedures for a consultation. An experienced doctor, like Dr. Harold Lancer, will be able to answer your questions and determine if PicoWay or Thermiva are the right treatments for you.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/best-face-mask-skin-type/,"Face masks are a luxurious way to hydrate, deep clean, or balance your skin. While they may seem like an extra step, they’re actually an important part of your skincare regimen. Even better, they encourage you to take a few minutes to yourself and relax—something we could all use.

For dry skin, look for masks that plump and hydrate with natural extracts and nourishing ingredients. These provide essential moisture and help minimize the appearance of wrinkles so your dehydrated skin appears smoother and suppler. Sheet masks are especially ideal for this as they create a barrier to cover the skin, minimizing water loss and creating just enough heat for the active ingredients to penetrate deeper. Lancer Skincare’s Lift and Plump Sheet Mask features rose water, Centella Asiatica extract, and sodium hyaluronate to provide deep hydration and help skin appear softer and younger. In addition, apple stem cell compounds and Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3 are active anti-aging ingredients that produce a tighter, more lifted appearance. Before applying any mask to dry skin, gently polish and cleanse your skin to remove dry skin cells, allowing beneficial ingredients to fully penetrate.
For oily skin with clogged pores, use masks that renew dull skin without overdrying it. Stripping your skin’s natural oils causes it to react by overproducing oil, further clogging pores and leaving your skin oilier. You want masks that gently clarify and nourish so your skin appears healthier and detoxified. Try Younger Revealing Mask Intense, which combines Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, a blended form of vitamin A that improves the look of your skin’s texture and helps skin look renewed, with an iron-rich mineral powder that provides ferromagnetic activity when removed with the magnet. The magnetic activity and active ingredients work together to penetrate the skin so skin is left looking rejuvenated and radiant. Before applying your mask, cleanse and polish your skin with warm water, working in upward, circular strokes. Dry your skin and apply the mask to both your face and neck.
For dull, uneven skin, look for masks that smooth and polish your skin, allowing light to better reflect off the skin’s surface. Dull skin is usually dry, but also suffers from a buildup of dead skin cells, masking skin’s radiance. Additionally, sunspots and uneven skin tone mute your skin’s natural glow. To restore dewiness, use a mask that brightens the appearance of spots while also providing nourishment and hydration, like Lancer Skincare’s Radiance Awakening Mask Intense. This velvety mask works overnight to provide rich moisture with active ingredients. Red algae extract delivers deep hydration while licorice extract and Triple Tone Neutralizing Complex target discolored skin tones to improve skin’s clarity and translucency. LES-10, a powerful antioxidant complex, polishes away dead skin and brighten dark spots for skin that looks younger, brighter, and more even. Apply to clean, dry skin before bed to receive the most benefits.
Face masks are an excellent way to nourish your skin at home, but be aware that each skin type benefits from a different kind of mask. Knowing how each mask works and what your skin needs ensures that you’re using a product that improves your skin the most.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/dr-harold-lancer-receives-beauty-enhancement-award/,"Dr. Harold Lancer was pleased to receive the “Beauty Enhancement Award” at the third annual Hollywood Beauty Awards on February 19th for his work as a world-renowned dermatologist to the stars. As the Hollywood Beauty Awards noted, Dr. Lancer has had the pleasure of working with many high-profile celebrities who sing his praises. His three decade long commitment to helping patients achieve radiant, youthful-looking skin is legendary in the industry and ultimately earned him this accolade.

The Hollywood Beauty Awards were founded by LATF USA in order to recognize the unsung heroes in the beauty industry—the dermatologists, makeup artists, hairstylists, fashion stylists, and photographers that create lasting Hollywood looks we seek to imitate year after year. Red carpet looks often set the style for the rest of us, and fashion icons are born on those carpets time and again.
Celebrities rely on beauty industry experts to help them look their best and achieve memorable looks for awards season, editorial photo-shoots, public appearances, and beyond. This star-studded ceremony and dinner gala—which benefits the M•A•C AIDS Fund—was created to venerate the experts who design and create these unforgettable looks. Of course, the canvas upon which other beauty experts rely is Dr. Lancer’s specialty—glowing skin that appears firm and young. Dr. Lancer helps create flawless-looking skin for every patient he works with, which is why he’s been presented with this distinction.

The “Beauty Enhancement Award” is particularly meaningful to Dr. Lancer as his interest in beautiful, healthy-looking skin grew from an accident in his childhood that resulted in severe burns over 10% of his body. Even at such a young age, Dr. Lancer learned that restoration of the skin is vital to skin’s health and beauty. His Ivy league education and impressive medical career helped Dr. Lancer amass the kind of knowledge that helps him transform his clients’ skin. The combination of in-office procedures and The Lancer Method, based on his incredible anti-aging Lancer Skincare line, produce winning results not just for him, but for his clients’ skin, too.
Dr. Lancer commented on his success, saying, “I’m thrilled to have been honored at The Hollywood Beauty Awards. My patients are always my first priority and I’m passionate about changing the way people think about their skin. The Lancer brand is going from strength to strength and I’m proud to say that you haven’t even seen the best of it yet. I’m very excited to continue to develop the brand and my practice in 2017 and I am humbled by being awarded with The Beauty Enhancement Award.”

The acknowledgement of Dr. Lancer’s achievements at this all-star event by fellow beauty industry experts who understand the expertise, creativity, and delicacy of behind-the-scenes beauty work was a privilege. Dr. Lancer accepted the honor with deepest thanks to all the patients who make his work rewarding every day.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/what-is-endymed/,"Spring is on its way, which means we’ll be showing a lot more skin in a matter of weeks. With shorter hemlines, sleeveless silhouettes, deep-V necklines, and bright sunlight on the horizon, you might be looking into ways to make your skin look younger and firmer, even in the harshest lighting. Exercise, a healthy diet, and advanced skincare are all a fantastic start, but sometimes skin needs additional treatments to look revived, refreshed, and its best. For that, you’ll want to head to your dermatologist for the most advanced treatments for improving the way your skin looks and feels.

Skin that shows the signs of aging quickly—like your face, neck, and chest—or skin with deep scaring or acne scaring can benefit greatly from laser treatments, or treatments that use radio frequency skin firming or microneedling. Older versions of laser treatments took a while to work effectively and had the potential to be quite painful, so patients would be concerned about not just the pain, but how many sessions they would have to endure to see results. Newer treatments, like Endymed, are changing all that.
When it comes to rejuvenating skin, Endymed Intensif is the most advanced radio frequency technology on the market for refreshing the skin on areas of your face, neck, chest, and body. This minimally invasive procedure combines microneedling and focused radio frequency to improve the texture of your skin. The procedure works by emitting heat into the dermis, which triggers the skin’s natural healing process. The result is skin that looks visibly revitalized and renewed, with improved elasticity.
Endymed Intensif’s non-insulated gold needles work in harmony with Endymed’s Fractional Pulse Mode technology to produce more heat safely inside the dermis for better results. The unique delivery of the energy into the dermis minimizes risk to the surrounding tissue and skin surface. The adjustable high precision needle depth allows for customized treatment strength depending on the area being treated. A shorter needle depth is used for thinner skin, while thicker skin can be treated with a deeper delivery. This treatment is ideal for patients who are looking for improvement of acne and acne scaring, stretchmarks, deep wrinkles, and more, though Endymed Intensif 3DEEP technology also successfully minimizes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
If you find yourself heading for the door at the mention of needles, fret not. You will be pleased to know that numbing cream is used on your face first, and Endymed Intensif only requires relatively short treatments, with fewer passes over the skin per treatment because of the efficient Endymed 3DEEP technology. Treatments typically only take between 15 to 25 minutes, depending on the skin area and concern you’re treating. The shorter time and smaller number of passes over the skin ensures better comfort for you and faster recovery times for results you’ll see sooner.
You might also be surprised to learn that while the procedure does involve miniscule needles, there is no bruising and no bleeding after the treatment, though you may need three to five days of downtime after the procedure. Patients report some redness immediately following the treatment, followed by slight puffiness as the healing begins. After that, you may experience some roughness or flakiness on day three or four as your skin continues to heal itself and reveal the results of the treatment.
After the treatment, you will immediately see visible improvement, even as your skin recovers from the procedure. After your skin is completely healed in three to seven days, you’ll see a noticeable difference in the way your skin looks and feels. You’ll also see considerable improvement for some time after your treatment is complete. A treatment that continues to provide results even after it’s over? That’s a benefit we can all get on board with.
Depending on the results you’re looking for, most patients need between three and six treatments spaced out between one to six weeks apart to achieve optimal results. For particularly deep acne scars, an additional one to two treatments may be necessary. However, since you’ll continue to see improvement over time, you may find that you don’t need that final treatment after all! Make sure you see an experienced, Board-certified dermatologist for accurate treatment recommendations.
Endymed’s 3DEEP technology makes improving your skin’s elasticity easier, safer, and more effective than it has ever been before. If you’re looking for quick improvement of your skin’s texture and firmness with minimal discomfort, Endymed Intensif is likely an excellent choice for you. Don’t waste time feeling like you have to cover up anymore. Allow a trusted dermatologist and Endymed Intensif to refresh your skin and your confidence for skin you feel good about showing off. Spring is the time for renewal! Call your dermatologist and find out if Endymed is right for you.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/universal-tips-happier-healthier-skin/,"While each skin type needs something just a little different, there are some universal skincare types that will help keep your skin happier and healthier in 2017. Healthy skin is clean, hydrated, and nourished, so make sure you address the health of your skin from the inside out.

Dry skin is often a result of dehydration, and dehydrated skin can be discolored and crepey-looking. In order to ensure your skin maintains a smooth and plump appearance and an even-looking tone, drink plenty of water to keep your skin cells hydrated. To keep skin moisturized on the outside, too, avoid overly dry environments. In the winter, heaters dry the air, which keeps your skin from retaining essential moisture. Use a cool mist humidifier to reintroduce moisture to the air and use a nourishing moisturizer day and night to keep essential moisture in your skin. Healthy, hydrated skin looks happier, younger, and more radiant.
Happy, healthy skin also requires sufficient nutrition and a balanced diet, which can help in preventing wrinkles, acne, eczema, and very dry or very oily skin. A balanced diet includes healthy fats that provide vital nutrients and help keep your skin nourished. Good fats, like Omega-3, -6, and -9 fatty acids, are responsible for keeping your cell membranes strong so nutrients and water can enter the membrane, but waste stays out. Healthy skin cell membranes result in skin that looks softer, suppler, and firmer. Ensure that your diet includes plenty of these healthy omega fatty acids by eating nuts and seeds, avocados, tuna, salmon, and healthy oils like olive, safflower, or canola. You can also add a fish oil supplement to your diet to add a boost of beneficial fats to your daily nutrition and help ensure beautiful skin.
Skin can benefit from regular exercise, which is a great way to maintain healthy circulation, boosting your skin’s radiance and helping eliminate toxins for clearer, more even-looking skin. However, working out in makeup can cause clogged pores and exacerbate acne and other skin issues like rosacea or psoriasis. Cleanse skin thoroughly before exercising to get rid of debris, dirt, and free radicals on the surface of your skin that can clog pores and cause skin problems. While working out, use a clean towel to dab sweat from your face rather than using your hands. After you’re finished exercising, wash your face and rehydrate your skin with a soothing moisturizer that won’t irritate skin after a workout. Your body will feel renewed and reenergized, and your skin will look radiant and healthy.
Skincare can make a big difference in how your skin looks, but you also need to nourish your skin from the inside. Take care of your body and your skin, and you’ll see the results right on your face. Follow these universal skincare tips for happy skin that looks youthful and radiates health.
Universal Tips for Happier and Healthier Skin was last modified:  March 30th, 2021 by Dr. Harold Lancer",Universal Tips for Happier and Healthier Skin,
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/what-is-ultherapy/,"Somewhere in our mid-30s or early 40s, we look in the mirror one day and realize our skin looks different than it used to. Over time, skin loses elasticity and collagen, causing the telltale sagging and loose skin that signifies aging. Jawlines loosen, cheeks begin to fall, eyebrows and eyelids droop, and chins start to look weaker than they are. Time and gravity can be cruel, and this loose skin is one of the principal complaints dermatologists see. Yet even those who are most bothered by the touch of time and gravity on their skin are often hesitant to sign up to get poked by needles, injected with fillers and neurotoxins, or go under the knife, fearing the unnatural results and complications that can come with these procedures. So, is there an option that doesn’t require these kinds of invasive treatments?

There is indeed. Ultherapy is a non-surgical procedure using ultrasound technology to lift and tighten skin. As Dr. Lancer is a proponent of non-invasive procedures, the surgery averse and needle phobic can rejoice in the knowledge that there are no neurotoxins, no needles, and no cuts of any kind involved with this treatment. In fact, it’s the only treatment cleared by the FDA to dramatically lift skin without requiring anything invasive at all. The ultrasound energy used by Ulthera reaches deep into the tissue beneath your skin to stimulate the production of natural connective proteins. The results are natural because they come from your skin’s naturally occurring regenerative process. It’s your skin, but upgraded.
How Does Ulthera Work?
Unlike lasers or injectables, Ultherapy circumvents the surface of the skin entirely, using ultrasound energy to delve deep into the tissue at the right depth and the right temperature to safely stimulate the skin’s natural healing process. Because Ultherapy is an ultrasound procedure, specialists are able to use ultrasound imaging to see the layers of tissue being treated and pinpoint the ideal location for focused treatment and the best possible results. In just one treatment, this technology naturally smooths and lifts your skin, counteracting the signs of aging on your face, neck and décolleté over two to three months.
Ulthera treatments are concentrated and efficient, for maximum results in minimal time. Rather than having to treat your entire face to see the results in one area, you can specifically target your double chin and sagging brow. Of course, you can still go for gold and treat your entire face, but it’s not required for great results. Patients generally only need one treatment for successful results, but many patients opt for additional touch-up treatments down the road as time marches on and skin continues to age.

What to Expect from Ultherapy
If you’re considering Ultherapy to naturally lift your skin, make an appointment with a trusted dermatologist for an initial consultation. Talk to your dermatologist about areas of your skin you’d like to see improved and be clear about the results you want to see from Ultherapy. Whether you’re hoping for a chest free of the lines left by a lifetime of side-sleeping or a jawline without jowls, being open and honest with your doctor is important for assessing the potential success of the treatment. If your dermatologist feels you’re a good candidate for Ultherapy, there are no preparations required—just another benefit of a non-invasive treatment.
When you arrive for your Ultherapy treatment, you’ll likely be given something for pain management as some patients experience varying discomfort as the ultrasound deposits energy inside the tissue. Your skin will be cleansed and each area receiving treatment will be marked and identified. Then, ultrasound gel will be applied to your face before the Ulthera wand is placed on your skin. Your specialist will begin by using only the ultrasound imaging to identify the ideal depth and location for the treatment energy to target. At this point, the treatment itself has not yet started and you’ll be feeling quite comfortable. Once the energy deposits begin, you may feel what has been described as shocks or zaps as each deposit is made. The sensation will vary depending on the treatment area and the depth of the energy deposited. Treatments take between 30 and 90 minutes, depending on the size and location of the treatment area.
After your Ultherapy treatment, you may experience some flushing or mild swelling, tingling, sensitivity, or bruising, all of which should recede relatively quickly. There is almost no downtime with this treatment—none if you’re comfortable going to the office or the grocery store with a slightly swollen jawline—so you’ll be back to your life and regular activities right away.
See the Results of Ulthera on Your Skin
Some patients see some immediate lifted results in the first few days after the treatment, with full results continuing to become evident over the next eight to 12 weeks. By the third month, most patients are experiencing a noticeable youthful boost in their skin and getting compliments on their refreshed appearance. Skin looks tighter and lifted, as though the clock has been turned back a few years.

If you’ve gone from “What is Ultherapy?” to “I need it now!” find a skilled medical practitioner experienced with Ulthera to receive your treatment. A knowledgeable dermatologist with an established practice—like Dr. Harold Lancer and the renowned Lancer Dermatology Clinic—can be trusted to understand how skin and muscle tissue work together, as well as fully understanding your body’s natural regenerative processes. Only an expert can ensure you get the best possible results for your skin with Ulthera. You can enjoy naturally lifted skin without an invasive procedure. Stop the clock and give your skin a lift with Ultherapy.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/preparing-oscar-night/,"On Oscar night, all eyes are on the stars. The chatter is about what the rich and famous will wear and how they will look walking the famed red carpet. A night as big as the Oscars calls for only the best for Hollywood’s biggest names, and when it comes to dermatologists, Dr. Harold Lancer is the best of the best. It’s no surprise that devoted celebrity clients flock to his office for youthful and radiant-looking skin in time for the glamorous evening.
Without fail, Dr. Lancer’s talent was in high demand leading up to the coveted award show. He often sees between 50 and 70 clients per day as the annual big night nears, and this year was no different. Most of Dr. Lancer’s clients religiously follow his pragmatic health recommendations already. This includes the healthy diet he advocates in his book with plenty of lean protein and healthy fats. Clients also stick to advanced custom skincare routines, Polishing, Cleansing, and Nourishing their way to exquisite skin using The Lancer Method. And many clients go the extra step and come in for monthly micropolishing or microneedling to improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
In the weeks leading up to the awards, prominent clients come to Dr. Lancer for additional skincare recommendations and treatments to further improve the appearance of their skin’s tone, smoothness, and firmness in time for the biggest Hollywood night of the year. Clients undergo innovative procedures like LED light treatments, ultrasound treatments like Venus Viva, and laser treatments like PicoWay. These popular procedures are highly effective in refining the look of skin texture and tone while also gentle enough to be done fairly close to awards night. Dr. Lancer also recommends celebs partake in stem cell facials—either algae or placenta based—to nourish the skin, leaving the skin looking firmer.
Just like in years past, in the days and hours preceding the Oscars, Dr. Lancer was accessible to treat his famous clientele to alleviate stress-based blemishes and skin irritations. Stress can cause a host of objectionable skin reactions—even for A-list celebs—so he was prepared for last-minute appointments at all hours to treat any skin emergency. In fact, Dr. Lancer is ever-ready for his celebrity clients. He has a bedroom adjoining his office so he can doze there on the busiest nights of the year to see clients even at the eleventh hour.
As you watched actors and actresses revealing lustrous skin on the famous Oscar night, it’s likely the skin you admired belonged to one of Dr. Lancer’s clients. Dr. Lancer saw the most renowned names in Hollywood before the big event to guarantee they were red-carpet ready. He aided clients through weeks of pre-event skincare regimens and treatments to not only make their skin look magnificent, but give them the coveted inner glow we all crave.
The Oscars are a good reminder that we deserve the time to treat ourselves, too. Glowing skin is not a celebrity exclusive. You can find ways to pamper yourself so you feel rejuvenated and invigorated for wherever life takes you. Whether it’s a luxurious, premium skincare experience or making your own skin red-carpet ready, magnificent-looking skin can be yours with The Lancer Method.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/silhouette-instalift-facelift-without-surgery/,"One morning you wake up, look at your reflection, and realize you look older than you feel. You no longer recognize the person gazing back at you. The way your skin is beginning to droop makes you look tired and it doesn’t reflect your youthful personality. You consider whether you’re willing to undergo surgery to repair the damage done by time, gravity, and the sun, but it’s a daunting undertaking. Ultimately, you don’t feel ready to undergo the cost or the time commitment a surgery requires, and the risks of a full surgical facelift aren’t worth it for you. Does this mean you’re out of options?

Not necessarily. Over the years, our skin begins to produce less collagen, causing skin to sag and lose firmness. We watch the effects of time on our face with displeasure, lightly lifting our skin with our fingers and wishing there was a way to reproduce those results without going under the knife. Eventually, advanced skincare, a great diet, and minor treatments aren’t enough to produce the results we’re looking for and, until recently, there hasn’t been a way to get a facelift without the full, invasive surgical procedure. Facelift surgery comes with very real risks, and many of us have seen the undesired results of a facelift gone wrong. For patients who want a more subtle outcome and aren’t willing to go under the knife, Silhouette InstaLift is now an excellent option.

What Is Silhouette InstaLift?
Silhouette InstaLift is a minimally invasive procedure that provides the lifting and tightening benefits of a facelift, without the surgery or recovery time. That thing you do when you gently lift your skin with your fingers in the mirror? Silhouette InstaLift does the same thing, but it lasts considerably longer.
In order to lift and re-contour your face, your dermatologist threads biodegradable sutures and bidirectional cones into your numbed skin. Cones facing one direction are anchored in subcutaneous tissue, while cones facing the other direction are used to lift and reposition skin for a more pleasing, youthful appearance. In addition to the literal lifting of tissue, the knots and cones on the sutures incite your body’s natural inflammatory response as they’re pulled through your tissue, causing your body to produce more of the skin’s main structural proteins. The thread and cones used are made from a commonly used polylacticoglycolic acid resin, which breaks down over time inside the body and is safely absorbed. As the sutures are absorbed, the production of connective proteins is stimulated in your tissue once again for a continued restoration of volume in your skin. The rejuvenation of this natural healing process helps you look younger, but still like you.
This FDA-cleared procedure is just a fraction of the cost of a standard surgical facelift, and the results are much more likely to be subtle and natural looking. Silhouette InstaLift is completed in-office, without general anesthesia, and takes about 30 to 45 short minutes. The results are immediate and recovery time is nearly non-existent, so you don’t have to worry about making excuses for why you’ve disappeared while you recuperate. You’ll be back to your regularly scheduled life right away. Over the next six to nine months, the disintegrating sutures will continue to stimulate the body’s natural regenerative process for continued volume and a boost in skin’s firmness. Overall, patients can expect the results to last between 18 to 36 months.
How Is a Silhouette Thread Lift Different from Other Facelifts?
For many of us, even as we search for solutions for maturing skin, the word “facelift” brings to mind images of unnaturally changed visages—something the majority of people want to avoid. Most patients want to look like themselves… about five years ago. Surgical facelifts are an option, but require sizable incisions—even with a limited incision facelift—and the results can be harder to predict. Scarring can be seen, making the results of a surgical facelift even more obvious. There’s also a certain stigma attached to a surgical facelift that doesn’t accompany other more minor procedures, so it’s not surprising people aim for other treatments whenever possible to address concerns without surgery.
Unlike traditional surgical facelifts, Silhouette InstaLift is minimally invasive, requiring no incisions. Because there are only needle-sized entry and exit points, there is no scarring and no downtime. This may sound like other thread lifts that were popular 15 years ago and claim many of the same benefits, but those were much less successful and had more complications. Older thread lifts used barbed sutures sewn into the face with blue surgical thread, which was sometimes visible through the skin. The old threads used were hard to remove and more prone to breaking, and infection was much more common. The results in the skin itself were sometimes obvious, causing stringy, irregular striations. InstaLift is different. Because a Silhouette Thread Lift uses a soluble thread material, these procedures create impressive, uplifted results without the unpleasant problems associated with older thread lifts.
You don’t have to go to extreme measures for extremely pleasing results. There is a way to match the way you feel on the inside to the way you look on the outside without the high cost and time-consuming recovery of surgery. What is Silhouette InstaLift? It’s the future of minimally invasive facelifts. If you’re looking to re-contour and lift the skin on your face and neck, but want natural-looking results and a low maintenance procedure, call a dermatology clinic, like Lancer Dermatology, that has experience performing Silhouette Thread Lifts. A Silhouette InstaLift could be the perfect solution for you and your skin.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/benefits-probiotic-yogurt-skin/,"You’ve probably noticed that skincare goes through trends in the same way that fashion does. From cucumbers on tired eyes to vampire facials, skincare seems to have seen it all. But now, many dermatologists are publicizing the benefits of simple ingredients—ingredients you often find in your own kitchen. Recently, Dr. Harold Lancer was featured on the Dr. Oz Show, where he discussed the anti-aging benefits of using probiotic yogurt on your skin.


How does using probiotic yogurt on your face help improve your skin? The word “probiotic” simply refers to a substance containing beneficial organisms. In this case, these organisms make your skin cells healthier and help reverse the appearance of the signs of aging. Because your lifestyle can affect the quality of your skin, many people find that they did not sufficiently protect their skin from the elements in their youth. Free radicals, toxins, and sun damage have a profound effect on the look of your skin’s health and radiance, and it may seem that once the damage is done, there’s no way to reverse it. Thankfully, there is something you can do about it!
Applying a probiotic yogurt mask is effective on top of your skin for the same reason that it’s effective for your digestive system. The live cultures in yogurt help to fight irritation by neutralizing and blocking toxins. When eaten, these live cultures keep the bacteria in your digestive system balanced, but when applied topically they do the same thing for your skin. The advantages of eating probiotics are fairly well known, but fewer people understand the advantages of topically applied probiotics. Dr. Lancer is well versed in the benefits of probiotic organisms for the skin, which is why he recommends using a probiotic yogurt mask to his clients.
In addition to using great skincare consistently, using probiotic yogurt on the face helps improve the look of your skin. Dr. Lancer shared his own DIY yogurt mask recipe with Dr. Oz, so you can enjoy the benefits of probiotic yogurt on your skin yourself. This simple mask—which combines one cup of Greek yogurt, one tablespoon of honey, and three tablespoons of oats (either ground into powder, or used whole)—is ideal for use on a tired or dull complexion. Use in conjunction with The Lancer Method and apply the mask after your skin has been thoroughly Polished and Cleansed. Apply gently in a circular fashion and leave the mask on your skin for 15 to 20 minutes, then rinse thoroughly. Follow with the Nourish step to seal in the nutrients.
Using this mask consistently can reduce the appearance of irritation and redness in your skin, helping your skin look healthier and more radiant. Even better, since this mask uses ingredients found in your own kitchen, Dr. Lancer points out that you can make this mask anytime, without heading to a salon, spa, or dermatologist’s office. Try using this probiotic yogurt mask twice a week, in addition to your regular use of The Lancer Method. You can explore other Lancer Skincare Masks and products to complement your DIY mask, too—it’s a way to bring your dermatologist home with you so you can achieve and maintain glowing, younger-looking skin wherever you are and whenever you’d like!

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/dermatology-treatments-in-summer/,"When summer arrives, many of us become suddenly aware of our skin’s imperfections. Time in the sun can be unequivocally therapeutic, but it also means more sun damage. Joyful hours in the sunshine can also come with sunspots, dull or uneven skin tone, sagginess, and fine lines and wrinkles. So are there dermatology treatments that allow you to revel in the summer sun and still treat your skin to keep it looking youthful, radiant and healthy all season? Absolutely. Just select a regimen of in-office dermatology treatments that pinpoint and treat the results of UV damage, as well as skincare treatments that treat and protect your skin from further harm. 
Protect Your Skin After Laser Treatments with Dermatologist Sunscreen
Dermatologists often recommend laser treatments for uneven skin tone, age spots, sunspots, and other hyperpigmentation as they offer dramatic results in a relatively short period of time. Dr. Harold Lancer is especially fond of what he has coined The Cosmopolitan Peel—a Depigmentation Treatment ideal for treating red and brown scars, hyperpigmentation, discoloration, and fine lines and wrinkles. Patients are able to see noticeable improvement in their skin tone’s appearance within just one week!
Although many people think you can’t do laser treatments in the summer, it’s actually fine if you’re vigilant about protecting newly treated skin from the sun. Dermatologist sunscreen is a must after a laser treatment. Look for an SPF 30 sunscreen that both protects and treats your delicate skin. Sheer Fluid Sun Shield Broad Spectrum SPF 30 is perfect, as it protects your skin from UV damage without feeling heavy or greasy. It also contains luxurious anti-aging ingredients to help newly treated skin look younger and healthier.  And, because the formula goes on smooth and weightless with a velvety finish, it’s ideal for use as a makeup primer. Wear sun protective clothing, too, especially if your neck or chest has been treated. Grab a chic wide-brimmed hat and big, glamorous sunglasses, and you’ll look elegant and stylish while protecting your skin.
Sagging Skin Treatment for Sun-Damaged Skin
Believe it or not, sagging skin is a side effect from sun exposure, too. The sun’s UV rays cause the elastin and collagen in our skin to break down over time, making skin lose plumpness and elasticity. Loss of elastin and collagen cause an increase in fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin, making you look older than you are. Thankfully, there are sagging skin treatment options to help you feel good about your skin again.
Silhouette InstaLift is an ideal sagging skin treatment that’s easily completed in your dermatologist’s office, even in the summer. The procedure lifts and tightens by threading biodegradable sutures into your skin to gently lift your tissue. You get the advantages of a facelift without an invasive surgery, scars, or needing to take time off for recovery. Since Silhouette InstaLift is minimally invasive, you can literally walk in, get the procedure done, and walk right back out 45 minutes later with immediate results. And because your body continues to produce connective proteins as the sutures break down and are absorbed into your skin tissue, you’ll continue to experience increased volume and firmness in the skin for 18 to 36 months.
Another sagging skin treatment that has gained popularity in the beauty industry is hydrating face masks, which keep treated skin looking firm and healthy. Sheet masks are especially effective, helping active ingredients sink deep into your skin with the heat created beneath the mask itself. Our Lift and Plump Sheet Mask features highly concentrated apple stem cell compounds and Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3 to provide a tighter looking more lifted appearance. Quench sun-parched skin with natural humectants like rose water, sodium hyaluronate, and Centella Asiatica extract. After just 15 minutes luxuriating beneath one of these sheet masks, your skin will look hydrated and absolutely glowing.
Battling Summertime Acne
Anyone prone to breakouts knows summer is bound to bring on a new outbreak of pimples. With higher temperatures and increased humidity, even the most vigilant face-washers discover that sand, sweat, and dirt get trapped in makeup and sunscreen and lead to new congestion. Luckily, there’s something you can do about it. Head to your dermatologist’s office for an Anti-Acne Treatment to help naturally exfoliate your skin, clear it of breakouts and help prevent future acne. This treatment, which stimulates natural metabolic exfoliation, is excellent for sensitive skin and acne-prone skin alike, and helps patients with congested skin experience a clearer, more balanced complexion.
Along these lines, using a gentle daily face exfoliator can help fend off summer breakouts by sloughing off dead skin cells and impurities that clog your pores. The Method: Polish helps keep pores free of surface debris with quartz and sodium bicarbonate—pure mineral exfoliators that gently polish skin.  In addition, natural chemical exfoliators, like pomegranate and pumpkin extracts, help clean pores and prep skin for other treatments. Since skin’s natural regenerative processes slow as we age, a daily face exfoliator is essential to encouraging your skin’s natural cell turnover. Daily polishing not only helps clear skin of acne-causing impurities, but it also helps your skin look fresh and young.
The right combination of treatments allows you to fight signs of aging and sun damage while continually improving the look of your skin. It might sound too good to be true, but it isn’t. Discover the difference that dermatology treatments can make to your summer skin—talk to your dermatologist today so you can be well on your way to healthy, bright, and fresh skin wherever your summer adventures lead you.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/summer-skin-roundup/,"Summer is here, and with it comes long, carefree days in the sunshine. But make sure you still put plenty of care into your skin! Your skincare routine changes slightly each season, and though you might want to skimp on products when temperatures rise, you should actually be extra vigilant with your skin regimen. This doesn’t mean piling on tons of products—just adjust what you use and when you use it to protect your skin and keep it looking beautiful.

Cleansing is one part of your skincare routine that should remain consistent every season. Even when it’s tempting to skip steps in the heat, summer skin requires extra care to stay healthy and properly protected. The three consistent steps in The Lancer Method—Polish, Cleanse, and Nourish—will keep your skin glowing and youthful, even during the dog days of summer.
As always, start with polishing your skin to remove dull, dead skin cells from the surface. Summer skin is often swathed in layers of sunscreen, sweat, and makeup gritty with sand. Polishing your skin helps remove that surface debris to help prepare your skin to receive the beneficial ingredients when you moisturize. The exfoliators in The Method: Polish are gentle enough to polish without abrading sun-sensitive summer skin. You’ll also be encouraging natural cell turnover, resulting in skin that continues to look younger and healthier with a warm summer glow.
It’s not surprising to hear that cleansing is particularly important in the summer. The combination of waterproof makeup, extra time spent swimming the effects of the sun’s heat means your skin needs to be washed thoroughly.  In order to wash properly, start with a gentle cleanser to clear away the environmental toxins and sweep away any remaining debris your polish has gently loosened from the skin’s surface.  The goal is to ensure skin is prepped to absorb the good ingredients you want rather than the impurities you’re exposed to over the course of each day. If you’ve experienced a significant increase in sun-exposure, try facial cleansers for sensitive skin. The Method: Cleanse Sensitive Skin incorporates soothing ingredients like oat extract and licorice root extract to calm delicate, vulnerable skin.
If you’re tempted to skip moisturizer in the summer thinking that warmer temps, higher humidity, and often-accompanying oiliness make moisturizer unnecessary, think again. Your skin still needs nourishing hydration, even in summer weather. In fact, extra sun exposure can mean your skin needs even more hydration! If your skin gets oilier than usual in summer months, try switching to a moisturizer that controls oil like The Method: Nourish Oily-Congested, with lilac stem cells and salicylic acid. Just keep in mind that acids like glycolic or salicylic acid can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, so be especially dutiful about applying anti-aging sunblock and wearing protective clothing.
If you feel despondent at the thought of applying big white globs of sunblock, you’re not alone. Applying heavy sunscreen can feel like a chore, so we often don’t use enough to get the protection we really need. However, since summer equals more hours of sunlight and many more hours out enjoying it, your morning application of sunscreen on your face, neck, and chest isn’t enough. To remedy this, make sure you reapply a sunscreen, like Sheer Fluid Sun Shield Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen, every two to three hours, or after swimming or excessive perspiration. This sheer, weightless sunscreen is a pleasure to apply, with a smooth, velvet finish that never feels heavy or greasy.
When you’re ready for makeup, stick with lightweight formulas that let your skin shine through while offering skincare benefits. Start with a primer that smooths the appearance of pores, fine lines, and wrinkles and softens the look of imperfections. The new Studio Filter Pore Perfecting Primer from Lancer Skincare provides all those benefits, plus a velvety texture that helps minimize oil, and allows makeup to glide over the top for a perfect summertime look. Follow with an illuminating treatment like Dani Glowing Skin Perfector to add natural radiance.  This combination will help brighten your complexion without covering your skin’s natural summertime glow. Then, spot treat with a moisturizing eye concealer for natural-looking coverage of dark circles. Studio Light Flawless Eye Concealer includes caffeine, soft-focus minerals, and hydrophobic pigments to brighten your under-eye skin and offer lasting coverage. Ingredients like sodium hyaluronate and our amino acid complex provide immediate improvement to the look of puffiness while minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Choose makeup that benefits your skin, and enjoy the best of both worlds.
Finally, remember that what you eat affects your skin’s appearance! Stick with a diet rich in seasonal vegetables and fruits so you and your skin get the maximum benefits out of the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants in summer seasonal produce. Eat organic whenever possible and make sure the majority of your diet is made of low-sugar veggies. Drink lots of water every day to keep up with the heat and keep your skin hydrated from the inside out.
Your summer skin routine doesn’t need to be complicated. Protect and nourish sun-kissed skin with luxurious ingredients that help improve the look of your skin. With the right skincare routine, you can enjoy beautiful, radiant skin all summer long.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/dietary-dos-and-donts-for-great-skin/#more-962,"Maintaining a healthy diet affects your skin just as much as what you use to take care of it. To help you make the most of your anti-aging skincare lifestyle, here are Dr. Lancer’s dietary dos and don’ts that can either complement or counteract your skincare strategies.

Here are a few things Dr. Lancer recommends you should be doing in order to make the most of your skincare:
Dietary Dos



Eat organic produce. Conventionally raised foods often contain hormones, antiobiotics, and pesticides that can disrupt your hormones or cause your body to react due to not recognizing the “cides.” Eat organic produce in abundance, especially when the produce is local and seasonal.


Eat more vegetables. While organic fruit is better than conventional options, be mindful of its sugar content, since sugar can contribute to acne breakouts and can inhibit your anti-aging products to work at their full potential. As vegetables are lower in sugar content, you can consume as many vegetables as you please.


Eat organically-raised meat and poultry. When you do indulge in meat and poultry, choose organically-raised sources in order to avoid growth hormones, steroids, and antibiotics.


Drink plenty of water every day. We suggest 13 cups per day for men and 9 cups for women daily, but be mindful of your water intake, especially if you exercise and sweat or live in a hot, humid environment.


Here are a few things Dr. Lancer recommends you should not be doing:
Dietary Don’ts



Cut back on dairy. For those who can’t completely give up their favorite dairy products, cut back and only consume organic dairy products to avoid hormones. However, experiment and try new alternatives. There have been major advances in creating tasty dairy alternative, such as creamy cashew milk with only 30 calories per serving in some cases.


Cut back on sugar. Most Americans consume too much sugar according to numerous reports, including the USDA. Sugar can trigger hormonal shifts in the body and intensify glycation, which can lead to a poor complexion and the breakdown of collagen.


Avoid wheat and gluten. The gluten-free movement has picked up a lot of followers in recent years, and while few people have Celiac Disease, a new study has shown that 40% of adults have some form of gluten or wheat sensitivity or intolerance. The Department of Health and Human Services points out that gluten sensitivity is still under investigation, but many researchers have found that a sensitivity to gluten could be causing one to be acne-prone, rosacea-prone, or have sensitive skin.


Avoid salt. Too much salt causes you to retain water, causing you to not be able to flush out toxins. Salt can also irritate the lining of your pores, which also leads to inhibiting toxins from being flushed from your body, as well as exacerbating acne. Instead of salt, there are a number of spices, such as cayenne or turmeric, are both good for you and give you a kick.


Distinguish between good fats and bad fats to enhance your skincare regimen. Not all fats are created equally. The Dietary Guideline for Americans recommends 25-35 percent of our diet should consist of healthy fats, which includes polyunsaturated fats (vegetable oils, fatty fish, nuts, and seeds), unsaturated fats (seafood, olive oil, and nuts), monounsaturated fats (avocados, peanut oil, and canola oil), and Omega-3 fatty acids (tuna, salmon, mackerel, sardines, etc.).Avoid these two types of fats: Saturated fat found in dairy products, red meat, and some plant products like palm oil. Trans fats is the second, which are added to a number of pre-packaged foods to preserve them, so check all labels. Dry skin is often caused by a lack of good fatty acids according to the National Institute of Health, so this is one dietary change that will make a big difference.


Skip fried foods. Not only are fried foods brimming with bad fats that fill you up so you don’t seek out good fats, the oil they are fried in becomes oxidized, which impacts protection against free radicals and oxidative stress. Fried foods can also contribute to high cholesterol, diabetes, and heart disease. There are many healthier versions, often baked, that allow you to indulge in your cravings while protecting your skin.


Avoid yeast. Many breads and baked goods contain Candida, a type of yeast, and can lead to glycation so skin appears to age faster and lose its plumpness. The CDC reports that there are 20+ types of Candida yeast naturally in the human body, and it can easily spread through the body particularly through your diet. This can lead to rashes, breakouts, and dry skin.


Withdraw from caffeine. Caffeine, which is often mixed with dairy in chocolate or a latte, dehydrates you and can ultimately lead to a “toxic overload” that wreaks havoc on your skin. Caffeine triggers your stress hormone, cortisol, to go into overdrive, causing you to feel as if you’re in a stressed-out state. This stress appears on your skin, causing a dull complexion, accelerating the aging process, and creating fine lines and wrinkles from lack of hydration.


Stay away from artificial sweeteners. While they might save you a few calories, it’s at the expense of your complexion. Insulin resistance can exacerbate acne, and although sweeteners aren’t really “sweet,” you’re tricking your brain into thinking you’re consuming sugar. It may not cause negative skin reactions in everyone, but if you depend on artificial sweeteners to get your fix but suffer from complexion problems, it’s worth experimenting to see if stopping the sweeteners will stop your complexion woes.


Limit your alcohol intake. Alcohol dulls your complexion due to causing dehydration. Overindulgence may also cause acne flare-ups as well as facial flushing or red, spidery veins that will be difficult to fade. For every drink you have, drink one glass of water to ensure that you stay hydrated.


In order to make the most of your anti-aging skincare, follow an anti-aging lifestyle to the best of your abilities. It’s okay to indulge in a slice of cake, pizza, or cheeseburger every now and again, but just be sure to keep everything in moderation. Sticking to an anti-aging eating strategy allows you to engage in the anti-aging lifestyle full-circle—from the outside with your skincare routine, and the inside with your diet.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/introducing-lancer-legacy-youth-treatment/,"Over the years, it’s hard not to notice the way skin begins to dull and droop as it loses its youthful vitality. One morning as you’re getting ready for your day, you realize your skin is visibly aging and no longer looks as vibrant as it once did. Crepiness and creases emerge and your skin just isn’t as firm and glowing as it used to be.  While we know that we can’t turn back the hands of time, there are ways we can help improve the appearance of our skin to help us achieve a fresh, youthful looking complexion, without resorting to drastic measures.  Dr. Harold Lancer has dedicated his career to helping his patients achieve that fresh not frozen look they desire.  He has even developed a product that can help them do just that.

Dr. Lancer’s Legacy Youth Treatment is a luxurious cream that helps rejuvenate skin’s youthful appearance, using five custom formulated complexes to address skin concerns. These innovative complexes, incorporating over 30 high quality ingredients were designed to help skin recapture the appearance of vitality while providing a vital moisture barrier to encourage water saturation and protect skin’s antioxidant defenses. Lancer Legacy™ Youth Treatment is unique—not only for its groundbreaking complexes, but also for the way the compounds work together to help skin recapture a more youthful look.
Each of the five complexes works to support five essential functions. Our Youth GF Complex fosters skin’s vibrant appearance by incorporating a peptide blend of advanced factors (EGF, IGF-1, acidic FGF, basic FGF and VEGF), amino acids and vitamins to help nourish and revitalize the skin for a youthful and renewed appearance.  To give your skin a firmer, more lifted appearance, our Firming Mesh Complex is infused with Peruvian Tara fruit extract and ceramides. This complex improves the look of skin elasticity and firmness while reducing the appearance of damage caused by environmental elements. To soften the appearance of lines and creases in the skin, Dr. Lancer developed the Mitosmooth Compound.  Derived from macro-algae, this energizing compound promotes smoother-looking skin that appears perfectly refined and vibrant. The Aquadermal Complex, a unique blend of amino acids and hyaluronic acids, keeps skin looking supple, hydrated, and smooth. Finally, skin is brightened and looks renewed with our Sativusbright Compound—a rich blend of saffron and sake, which uses tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonoids to improve the look of dark spots and help give skin the Lancer signature glow.
Over the course of his 30-year career as a dermatologist, Dr. Lancer has been searching for a topical treatment to help his high-profile clients achieve the naturally fresh look that he calls ‘believable beauty.’  He shares “Lancer Legacy™ Youth Treatment is the culmination of my life’s work and is designed to preserve and refresh your skin’s intrinsic beauty.”  It is this lifetime of careful development and precisely designed compounds that makes Lancer Legacy™ Youth Treatment, the perfect partner to help fight the signs of skin aging and become the ultimate Key to Achieving Believable Beauty.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/home-skincare-peels/,"When you’re researching ways to make your skin look younger and healthier at home, you’re bound to come across suggestions for at-home skincare peels. For some of us, the word “peel” is daunting and a little scary, but that’s because we’re unfamiliar with what peels do and the ingredients used in them. A peel is really just another term for exfoliating with the help of chemical ingredients. These chemicals, most of which are found in other anti-aging skincare, are incorporated in higher concentrations in at-home peels to slough off the top layer of dead skin cells and other surface debris to reveal the radiant, healthier-looking skin underneath. Once you know what’s in most peels and what they do, they’re really not scary at all.

The most exciting part of at-home peels is not only the benefits you’ll see on your skin, but the fact that you can do them in the comfort of your own home.  At-home skincare peels can produce a number of desirable results, and you don’t have to pay for a doctor’s visit to enjoy them.  They can improve the appearance of pores and help minimize excess oil, improve skin’s hydration and even support the efforts to combat acne. You can even help improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, as well as promote a brighter more even complexion.  Even if you’re skeptical that at-home skincare peels can really do all this, be reassured that this kind of deeper exfoliation is both effective and easy enough to do on your own. The exfoliating acids contained in peels help remove the dead, surface skin-cells and help encourage healthy cell turnover to reveal younger-looking skin. Depending on the peel and the acids used, the depth of exfoliation can vary and you may experience some tingling or pinkness afterward.
Let’s Talk Ingredients
What should you look for in an at-home skincare peel? Aim for a peel that incorporates alpha hydroxyl acids (AHAs) for more effective results. These acids—like glycolic acid and lactic acid are common in skincare products, and peels using these ingredients are light enough for home use. Utilizing a combination of acids at once is more effective than using just one type of acid in high quantities, and using the combination at lower strengths is less likely to cause irritation. For peels with higher concentrations of acids, look for a controlled delivery system so you’re sure to use the right amount and not overwhelm your skin.
Peel and Reveal: Skincare Results
You can expect to see a number of positive results on your skin after using an at-home skincare peel.  You may notice a reduction in the appearance of your pores, which helps your skin look smoother and more even. Pores can actually become enlarged as sebum and dirt build up in them. A peel with AHAs helps break that up and sweep it away, leaving your pores cleaner and smaller. Your skin’s tone and texture will look brighter and more even as dead, discolored skin cells are removed, allowing younger-looking skin to take the stage instead. You’ll also notice improvement in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles as the top layer of dull skin is sloughed away and healthier, plumper-looking skin takes its place.
Maintain Your Refreshed Look
After using an at-home peel like Caviar Lime Acid Peel, your skin is primed and ready to receive the benefits of anti-aging products. As such, do your peel in the evening so that you can stay out of the sun, and avoid applying makeup immediately after your peel. You’ll be able to apply your most nurturing, beneficial products and then go to sleep, allowing your skin to profit from the natural healing and regeneration cycle that takes place while you’re sleeping.
After a peel, use a nourishing moisturizer right away to reinforce your skin’s moisture barrier. Look for hyaluronic acid and nurturing oils, like those in The Method: Nourish, for the ultimate treatment post-peel. After using an at-home skincare peel, your skin will be extra sensitive to the sun, so if you’ll be outdoors at all, use a dermatologist sunscreen like Sheer Fluid Sun Shield Broad Spectrum SPF 30 to protect your newly revealed skin from UV damage. Skin is more delicate after a peel, but it’s also prepared to absorb anti-aging ingredients, so using a sunscreen with skin benefits is ideal for protecting your skin. It’s also advisable to use gentle face cleansers to avoid irritating your skin or stripping it of essential moisture. If your skin is slightly pink or tingly after a peel, look for a cleanser like The Method: Cleanse Sensitive Skin with calming oat and licorice root extract to help soothe your skin while cleansing.
For your first foray into at-home peels, start slow to minimize irritation and take great care of your skin following the peel. Even if a peel says you can use it every day, begin with every other day (or every third day if you have sensitive skin) and work your way up to the desired frequency. Then, use plenty of dermatologist sunscreen and nourishing moisturizer after your peel to protect your renewed skin and help it recover.
Don’t be afraid of trying an at-home skincare peel! With proper use and luxurious, nurturing skincare afterward, your peel will reveal skin that appears more even and smooth for a radiant, youthful complexion.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/determining-skin-type/,"Determining your skin type can be daunting, but it’s essential to choosing the right skincare for your skin. Each skin type has different cleansing and hydration needs, as well as requiring treatments that address the concerns unique to each skin type. Get to know your skin type so you can treat it accordingly. With the right skincare and treatment, you’ll be left with the even, radiant, youthful-looking skin you want.

Know Your Skin Type
Understanding your skin type begins with paying attention to how your skin reacts after cleansing. Wash your face as you regularly do, but leave your skin alone for 1 hour after cleansing and see how it feels. Does it feel tight? Do you begin to see/feel oil anywhere? Looking at the categories below, clarify where your skin fits to help you customize your skincare for the best results for your skin.


Dry Skin: Feels tight or itchy without enough moisture. Becomes rough and flaky, accompanied by small pores. Rarely breaks out. 1 in 32 people (or 3.10% of the population) in the US have dry skin.


Oily Skin: Becomes shiny, with visible oil on tissue when skin is blotted. Enlarged pores and breakouts are common. Studies show between 40-55% of adults from age 20-40 have diagnosed low grade, persistent acne and oily skin.


Combination Skin: Enlarged pores and oil across forehead, nose, and chin. Parts of the face are normal or dry, and breakouts are not uncommon. The most common skin type. 80% of people from age 11-30 have acne outbreaks at some point.


Normal Skin: Fairly uniform without excess oil or flakiness. Breakouts are rare. This is the rarest skin type.


Sensitive Skin: Skin stings after washing or applying other skincare. Skin is often red or rashy. 62% of women say they have reactive, sensitive, or irritable skin.


You may appear to have one type of skin, or your skin can appear to have a combination of skin types—for example, oily and sensitive—depending on outside influences, your health, and hormone levels. Most people experience varying skin conditions over the course of a month, which is perfectly normal, although frustrating!
Know Your History
Even if your skin seems to fit neatly in one category, you might be surprised to learn that your skin reacts in unexpected ways due to your heritage. Understanding your ancestry can help you understand your skin—your visible pigmentation isn’t necessarily reflective of how your skin will behave. In addition to the way your skin looks, the way your skin heals is also determined by genetics.
So how can you learn more about how your ancestry affects your skin? By studying the Lancer Ancestry Scale (LAS), which accounts for five different skin types based on geography and heredity. Each skin type has its own challenges and benefits, and should be treated accordingly. Bonus: You’ll have the chance to learn more about your ancestral background and your skin type all at the same time.
LAS I is extremely fair skin that burns quickly and tends toward sensitivity. Your ancestors are:


Celtic


Nordic


Northern European


LAS II is fair skin that does not burn quickly, but still wrinkles, sags, and can scar easily. Your ancestors are:


Central, Eastern, or Northern European


LAS III is golden skin, possibly with olive undertones, that can scar easily or become easily inflamed. Your ancestors are:


European Jews


Native American and Inuit


Southern European and Mediterranean


LAS IV is olive or brown skin that can become easily inflamed and can tend toward acne. Your ancestors are:


Sephardic Jews


Central and South American Indian


Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese


Filipino and Polynesian


Southern European and Mediterranean


LAS V is black skin that can react to irritation with discoloration or texture changes. Your ancestors are:


Central, East, and West African


Eritrean and Ethiopian


North African and Middle East Arabic


To find your own LAS skin type, add up the four LAS numbers that correspond to your grandparents’ ethnicities on your maternal and paternal sides. Divide that total number by four to find your LAS score.
Though there is always risk with any treatment that requires healing, a higher LAS score means a higher risk of adverse reactions to treatments, particularly resurfacing treatments. Communicate your ancestral history with your dermatologist so they’re better able to anticipate how skincare or treatments may affect your skin. Researching your family history reveals more about your skin than you’d think!
Know the Right Skincare for Your Skin Type
Whether your skin is oily, dry, combination, or sensitive, everyone’s skin benefits from The Lancer Method. However, remember that each LAS skin type may also require different skincare treatments to treat unique concerns and achieve the best results. Understanding your LAS skin type helps you choose the right products for your skin. For example, both LAS I and LAS V skin types are susceptible to being sensitive and reactive. People with these skin type should slowly introduce Polish, as well as any anti-aging products, into their skincare routine to avoid irritating their skin and causing further reactions.
Regardless of your skin type, look for products like Radiance Awakening Mask Intense, which includes brightening and hydrating ingredients like antioxidant complex LES-10, silver vine extract, licorice extract, and red algae extract. These active agents help protect your skin while promoting a more balanced and even-looking complexion for radiant-looking skin. This mask is ideal for all skin types, ethnicities, and ancestral backgrounds, so it’s an excellent place to start for skincare that guards and improves the appearance of your skin’s tone.
Once you’ve determined your skin type based on your ancestry and how your skin behaves, you’ll be able to choose the right skincare for you. Knowing which skincare products best treat your skin’s distinctive concerns is the best way for you to achieve healthy, beautiful skin.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/lancerskinsquad-contest-celebrated-launch-caviar-lime-acid-peel/,"Lancer Skincare recently held a #LancerSkinSquad Giveaway contest on Instagram to commemorate the launch of the Caviar Lime Acid Peel,  our new at-home peel for A-list skin.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-our-3-step-skincare-routine/,"At Lancer Skincare, we model our regimen on a 3-step skincare routine, but we take a slightly different approach from other brands and beauty gurus. To clarify things, we created this guide that explains what the 3-step Lancer Method is and how to figure out which skin type regimen will fit your needs best.
The 3-Step Lancer Method
No matter what skin type you have, each Lancer Method skincare set follows the same three steps: polish, cleanse and nourish. Here’s what you need to know about each of these three steps and why they are essential:

Polish: The polish step involves exfoliating your skin. We recommend doing this after removing your makeup but before cleansing your skin for optimal results. Our facial scrubs combine physical and chemical exfoliation ingredients to immediately smooth your complexion out. Quartz crystals, pumpkin and pomegranate enzymes and salicylic acid are just some of the powerhouse ingredients that our scrubs include.
Cleanse: The cleanse step involves washing your face. Our cleansers are designed to leave your face feeling fresh and clean, not dry and stripped. Some of the ingredients we use to accomplish this are lilac stem cell compound, rice protein, amino acids and oat extract.
Nourish: The nourish step involves moisturizing your face with a lotion or cream. We formulated each of our Nourish moisturizers with a specific skin type in mind. We also incorporated hydrating and soothing ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, avocado and olive fruit oils, peptides and oat and chamomile extracts.

You can also add to our 3-step skincare with optional (yet very beneficial) products such as makeup remover wipes, serums, masks, peels and eye creams. These products supercharge your skincare routine and deliver even more effective results than the 3-step routine alone. We offer various skincare lines that target the following skincare concerns: fine lines and wrinkles, dark spots and uneven tone, redness and irritation, loss of firmness and acne and pore size.
Be sure to browse the Lancer Skincare online store to see everything that we offer and curate your best skincare routine possible. Don’t forget to grab a sunscreen that you can apply every morning as well!

The 3 Skin Type Sets
We offer three different Lancer Method sets tailored to three different skin types: oily-congested, sensitive-dehydrated and normal-combination. These sets cover the majority of skincare types and ensure that almost everyone can find a Lancer Method set that fits their needs. Here’s how to tell which Lancer Method set you need:

Oily-congested: If you struggle with oily skin and clogged pores, this set is meant for you. Many people who struggle with acne do well with this set, but you will also find these products effective if you are mostly worried about controlling oil rather than treating blemishes. Many people also enjoy using this set in the summer when their skin creates more sweat and oil.
Sensitive-dehydrated: On the other hand, you’ll want this set if your skin is prone to dryness, dullness, sensitivity and irritation. We designed these skincare products with soothing ingredients that will help to relieve redness and itchiness while ensuring that your skin gets the moisture and hydration that it needs.
Normal-combination: If neither of the above skin types sounds like you, then you probably have normal or combination skin. Your skin is neither too oily nor too dry (though you may have some areas that are slightly more oily than others; hence, “combination” skin). This skincare set is designed to help your skin maintain its natural balance without drying it out or smoothing it in thicker formulations.


If you’re still not sure which Lancer Method regimen is right for you, then consider trying one of our skincare travel kits. These kits are the perfect way to sample our products without committing to the full-size products. We also offer travel-size kits for many of our other products, so you can try them all out at once.
We also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on all Lancer Skincare products, whether they are travel size, full size or value size. If the products don’t work for your skin for whatever reason, simply contact us during that 30-day window to initiate a return or exchange. Get your next 3-step skincare routine from Lancer to start seeing a difference in your skin.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/8-essential-fall-skincare-tips/,"Fall is in the air, which means that it’s officially time to start transitioning from our summer to winter skincare routines. If you’re not sure what your fall skincare routine should look like during this transitional season, we’ve put together a guide to help you figure that out. Here are eight essential fall skincare tips to help you figure out your best skincare routine as you drink pumpkin spice lattes:
Choose a soothing cleanser.
Cleansing can be one of the most stripping and drying steps of a 3-step skincare routine. While this can help to control oil in the summer, it’s often too harsh for your skin once the weather starts to cool down. As we enter fall, switch to a more soothing cream or milk cleanser that won’t be as harsh on your skin.
Add in a hydrating serum.
Depending on your skin type, using a quality moisturizer like our Ultra Hydrating Serum may not be necessary during the summer months. However, as we move into fall, you might want to consider adding one into your daytime and/or nighttime routine. These serums help to attract water into your skin to keep it feeling plump, hydrated, and youthful.
Reassess your exfoliation routine.
Most people increase the frequency of their exfoliation in the summer to get rid of dead skin cells and control oil. But once the weather starts getting cold, you might want to reduce the frequency of exfoliation in order to prevent drying out your face. Exfoliation is a necessary part of any skincare routine, but it’s also quite potent; you want to hit the sweet spot of doing it often enough to get a smooth complexion, but not so frequent that you strip your skin barrier.
Switch to a thicker moisturizer.
If you’ve been using lightweight lotion for summer, fall is the time to think about switching to a thicker anti-aging cream for winter. Moisturizers help to seal in your skincare products and maintain a healthy oil balance so that your skin doesn’t become too dry or too greasy. When used in conjunction with a hydrated serum, a thicker moisturizer can stop dry skin before it even has a chance to get started.
Use an eye cream.
While dedicated eye care products and creams aren’t a required part of our 3-step skincare routine, we highly recommend them for anyone struggling with dry or crepey under-eye skin. The skin around your eyes is very delicate and often becomes dry and dehydrated before the rest of your face. Eye creams are also specifically formulated so that powerful ingredients like retinol and vitamin C can be applied to the eye area without issue.

Experiment with facial oil.
If even a thick cream isn’t cutting it for your dry skin, then you might want to experiment with a facial oil as we get further into fall. Facial oils like our Omega Hydrating Oil form an occlusive barrier on the surface of your skin, which helps to stop moisture loss. This can be applied as a layer over your moisturizer, or you can mix a couple drops into your moisturizer before applying it.
Keep using SPF.
During fall, the days get shorter, you spend less time outside, and the sun doesn’t seem as bright. So this means that you don’t have to wear sunscreen anymore, right? Wrong! You should still wear sunscreen every day to protect your face from UV rays that get through windows. Wearing sunscreen every day is one of the most effective things that you can do to prevent signs of premature aging such as wrinkles and dark spots.
Don’t forget about your lips.
While lip care is often considered an add-on, it should be an essential part of your fall skincare routine as the weather gets colder. Lips are exposed to the elements as well as foods and beverages, which means they often get chapped quickly. Apply a lip balm not just at night when you sleep, but throughout the day to help form a protective barrier on your lips.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/how-to-improve-skin-elasticity/,"By BLACKDAY / Shutterstock.com
Loss of skin elasticity is part of the aging process, but it can also be increased by certain environmental and lifestyle factors. On the flipside, having a high-quality skincare routine and protecting your skin from certain stressors can help to improve skin elasticity and slow down its loss. Read on to learn more about what skin elasticity is, why it matters, and how to improve skin elasticity.
What is skin elasticity and why does it matter?
Skin elasticity refers to your skin’s ability to “bounce back” after it is touched or you make a facial expression. Skin elasticity is what makes our skin look plump, tight, and youthful, and it helps to prevent dynamic wrinkles from becoming permanent. Collagen and elastin are the two main compounds that help create skin elasticity.
Unfortunately, we lose collagen and elastin starting in our twenties, with the loss being greatly accelerated after menopause. This loss of elasticity is also accelerated by environmental factors, including exposure to UV rays, smoking, pollution, and an unhealthy diet. Fortunately, there are steps that you can take to improve your skin elasticity.
How to Improve Skin Elasticity
Drink enough water.
If you’re dehydrated, then your skin won’t bounce back as quickly even if you are doing everything else on this list. Therefore, staying hydrated is extremely important. Most people need approximately three to four quarts of water a day, depending on individual needs and how much they sweat. Try to limit consumption of beverages that can have a dehydrating effect, such as caffeine and alcohol.
Wear sunscreen.
Wearing sunscreen every single day is one of the most effective things that you can do to improve skin elasticity. You should be applying a high quality sunscreen of at least SPF to all exposed skin — not just your face but also your ears, neck, and chest. Do this every single day, even if you are just sitting inside, since UV rays can penetrate windows.

Use a retinol.
Retinol and retinoid skin tightening creams help to encourage skin cell production and boost collagen and elastin layers in your skin, making them a powerful anti-aging skincare product. Retinols are best applied at night since they can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. You should also be extra diligent about wearing sunscreen during the day when using a retinoid.
Pick a peptide product.
While peptides haven’t been studied as extensively as retinols, there is some evidence that they can help to improve skin elasticity. That’s because peptides contain the building blocks of proteins, which encourages the skin to build collagen. Try our Lancer Skincare Triple Peptide drops if you’d like to incorporate them into your skincare routine!
Incorporate a hydrating serum.
Hydrating serums that are rich in ingredients like hyaluronic acid attract water to your skin, which helps it to appear plump. Hyaluronic acid serums hydrate your skin from the outside in, while drinking water hydrates it from the inside out, resulting in a powerful combination that supports skin elasticity. If you’re wondering “Why is my skin so dry even when I moisturize,” not using a hydrating serum could be the answer!

Exfoliate your skin.
Exfoliating serums and masks help to remove dead skin cells and encourage the production of new ones, promoting a more youthful complexion and improving skin elasticity. In fact, we think that skin exfoliation is so essential, we made it the first part of our Lancer Method 3-step skincare routine! You can also try our award-winning Caviar Lime Acid Peel if you’d like a more powerful exfoliation experience.
Get enough sleep.
Your skin repairs itself while you sleep, which is why getting good sleep is absolutely essential to improving skin elasticity. You should be getting at least seven to nine hours of deep sleep per night whenever possible. Observing good sleep habits, such as avoiding screens the two hours before bedtime, will contribute to you getting better sleep.
Consider an in-office treatment.
If your at-home treatments and lifestyle changes aren’t getting you the results you want, consider booking a professional treatment at a dermatology office like Dr. Harold Lancer’s. Treatment options include chemical peels, laser treatments, and dermabrasion; your dermatologist will work with you to create a treatment plan that will address your skin elasticity concerns.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/the-best-skin-care-routine-for-people-in-their-30s/,"Your skin’s needs change through your life, which means that you need to be updating your routine as you age. If you’re still sleeping in your makeup and using harsh cleansers even though you’re in your thirties, it’s time to update your skincare routine. Here are eight steps to follow to put together the best skincare routine for people in their thirties:
Cleanse gently.
Once you hit your thirties, you want to remove your makeup and cleanse your skin without stripping your natural oils. Once you’ve removed your makeup, it’s time to follow it up with a gentle milk or cream facial cleanser that will leave your skin feeling clean, but not dry or tight. You should follow this routine at night for sure — but if your skin feels dry when you wake up, then just rinse it off with some lukewarm water to remove residue.
Hydrate your skin.
If your skin doesn’t have enough water content, it will look dry and dull instead of plump and bouncy. That’s why it’s essential to incorporate moisturizing creams and serums into your skincare routine in your thirties. Choose serums that feature ingredients like hyaluronic acid, peptides, and glycerin — all of which will attract water to your skin and boost your hydration. These products should be used in both your morning and nighttime skincare routine for optimal results.
Incorporate antioxidants.
Antioxidants help to fight free radical damage from UV rays and air pollution that can hasten the appearance of premature aging. If you’re not already using antioxidants, then you definitely need to add them to your skincare routine in your thirties. Vitamin C is the most well-studied antioxidant, but there are plenty of others to choose from as well. We recommend applying your antioxidants in the morning to protect your skin against environmental stressors throughout the day.
Use a retinol.
Your collagen and elastin production slows down as you age, which can contribute to signs of aging. However, applying a topical retinol product like our Advanced Retinol Treatment can help to promote the development of both collagen and elastin, slowing down signs of premature aging. For best results, apply the retinol treatment at night, since it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Retinol can cause dryness as you get adjusted to it, so don’t hold back on your hydrating serums and nourishing moisturizers!

Treat acne and dark spots.
In your thirties, you might continue to struggle with hormonal acne breakouts, making acne self care a must-have addition to your skincare routines. You might also see dark spots develop, either from healing acne lesions or from sun exposure. Incorporating a dark spot remover into your routine can help to lighten the appearance of existing dark spots and prevent new ones from forming.
Moisturize and nourish.
Our skin produces less sebum as we age, which means that you might notice your skin becoming rather dry in your thirties. That’s why we made the Nourish moisturizer the crucial final step in our Lancer Method 3-step skincare routine. You should be applying a moisturizer every time you rinse or wash your face to promote a healthy balance of natural oils, which will help prevent your skin from becoming so dry.

Apply an eye cream.
Speaking of moisturizers, in your thirties you might want to start applying a dedicated eye cream if you haven’t already. While some moisturizers are safe to dab around the eye area, they aren’t really developed specially to treat the delicate skin around the eyes. Using a dedicated eye cream ensures that the skin around your eyes gets the nourishment that it needs, and also that any active ingredients in the cream won’t irritate your delicate skin.
Wear sunscreen always.
You should be applying quality sunscreen every single day as the last step in your morning skincare routine, no matter the season or forecast. You should apply sunscreen to all exposed skin, not just your face but also your ears, neck, and chest. You might even want to apply it to your hands if you are worried about getting age spots there.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/7-benefits-to-switching-to-luxury-skincare-products/,"If you’re wondering whether it’s worth it to switch from your drugstore products to a luxury skincare routine — such as the Lancer 3-step skincare sets — the short answer is definitely yes. The long answer is that luxury skincare products offer many different benefits, from unique formulations to higher concentrations of ingredients. Here are seven reason why you should consider switching to luxury skincare products like those offered by Lancer:
Research and Development
Every new skincare ingredient first needs to be discovered or developed in the lab, then extensively tested in various formulations — all of which requires investing in staffing and equipment. Part of the reason why drugstore skincare products are so cheap is because they use older ingredients that don’t require much research. Meanwhile, luxury skincare companies like Lancer invest in research and development to help discover innovative new ingredients that aren’t as widely available.
Concentration and Potency
Luxury skincare products like ours also typically include ingredients at a higher concentration level and/or ingredients in a more potent form when compared to drugstore products. This means that you will see results faster when using a luxury skincare product versus a drugstore product that will work more slowly because of the lower concentrations. Using higher concentrations of these ingredients raises the price, which is why drugstore products typically keep the concentrations as low as possible.
Sourcing
Another thing that sets luxury skincare products apart isn’t just what ingredients they include; it’s how they source them. Not all ingredients are created equal, and luxury skincare brands typically source premium ingredients that are higher in both quality and purity. So even if the name of an ingredient is the same on both a drugstore and a Lancer product label, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the ingredients are identical. Many luxury brands also focus on sustainably sourcing their ingredients in a way that is better to the environment.

Formulation
If you’ve ever thought that a lot of drugstore products seemed the same, there’s a reason for that. Many drugstore skincare companies license a base formula from the manufacturer, a process known as white labeling. Then they make a few tweaks to the formulation before putting it on the market. While this keeps costs low for drugstore skincare companies, it means that many of the products are fundamentally not that different from each other.
Meanwhile, luxury skincare companies such as Lancer Skincare develop their own formulas from scratch. Many of these formulas are also proprietary and not shared with any other companies. This results in unique formulations, such as decollete creams, that aren’t available from any other skincare brands. If you want to experience Lancer Skincare products, you’ll have to order them from us!
Texture and Feel
These unique, extensively tested formulations mean that most luxury skincare products have a much more pleasant texture and feel when compared to drugstore formulas. This makes the product more elegant and pleasant to use, resulting in a truly luxurious self-care experience. This is especially important for products like makeup removers and sunscreens, which many people skip using because they don’t like the feel of the product on their face. All of our Lancer skincare products are extensively tested to ensure they deliver the best experience possible. They also make for a great skincare gift for anyone who loves a quality beauty product. 

Packaging
Drugstore skincare typically uses plastic packaging, which is cheap and lightweight — but not good for the environment or aesthetically pleasing to look at or handle. In contrast, luxury skincare products use glass, metal, and other premium materials in their packaging. Not only do these materials look good on your vanity and feel great in your hand, but they are also more recyclable than plastic, making them a better choice for the environment.
Faster Results
As a result of all the other factors we’ve just delved into, luxury skincare usually offers faster and superior results when compared to drugstore skincare. Drugstore skincare is totally fine if you’re on a budget and can’t justify self-care splurges — but if you’ve got the money, then it’s worth investing at luxury skincare. After all, you only have one face, so you might as well take care of it!
At Lancer Skincare, we understand that not everyone is used to buying luxury skincare online. That’s why we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee so that you can shop our products with confidence. Grab a skincare travel kit if you’re looking to sample a bunch of products at once, or jump up to the value size if you’re looking to stock up.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/16-of-the-best-skincare-trends-to-follow/,"If you follow social media at all, then you know that there are plenty of viral skincare trends that you should avoid like using sunscreen to contour your face and applying lemon juice as an exfoliator. But what about the healthy, positive trends that are actually worth trying out? We’ve rounded up 16 skincare trends that aren’t just safe to try out — they will make a positive difference in your skin! From skin cycling to skincare products, here are the skincare trends that you should be following right now:
Skin Health
Previously, skincare used to only focus on what the skin looked like. However, over the past few years, a new focus on improving skin health as well as appearance has improved. Consumers now understand that supporting a healthy skin barrier and microbiome will lead to a better complexion, not the other way around. That’s why we have formulated all our skincare products with the high-quality ingredients that your skin barrier needs to stay healthy and strong. Of course, our products will give you a smooth and glowing complexion as well for double the benefits.

Sun Protection
Gone are the days when people used to cover themselves in tanning oil and lie out in the sun for hours on end. Today, we understand that sun exposure is the no. 1 contributor to premature aging, which is why sun protection is a skincare trend that’s here to stay. You should be applying anti-aging sunscreen with a protection of at least SPF 30 every single day. You should also apply sunscreen to all your exposed skin, not just your face, but also your ears, neck, decollete, arms, and hands. Reapply every two hours when you are in the sun to ensure adequate protection.
Skin Cycling
While skin cycling started trending earlier this year, this concept has been around for a while, and it’s definitely worth incorporating into your routine. Skin cycling is basically the idea of taking “rest days” in your skincare routine to give your skin a break from powerful active ingredients. For instance, your skin cycling routine might look like exfoliating on night one, a retinol on night two, and a rest on night three to give your skin time to recover. Skin cycling can be tailored to whatever products you are using and your skin’s needs. You might also want to change it up with the weather; some people need more rest days in the winter when their skin is drier.
Gentle Exfoliation
When exfoliation first started trending, many people blasted their faces with harsh chemicals, seriously harming their skin barriers in the process. Now, people are focusing on gentle exfoliation instead as a way to remove the dead skin cells without harming the skin barrier. Products like the Lancer Method Polish are gentle enough to be used several times a week or even every day, depending on what skin type you have. These products prove that exfoliating products don’t have to sting or burn to be effective, and that you get the results you want without a permanently red face.

Anti-Aging Skincare
It’s never too early (or too late) to get started on anti-aging skincare; we’re seeing many people in their twenties and even their teens get started on anti-aging skincare early. These products come in many different forms, including anti-aging creams, serums, oils, and more. Choose whichever ones best suit your needs and skin type to start slowing the development of premature signs of aging. Keep in mind that all Lancer anti-aging skincare products come with free shipping, so don’t hesitate to add them to your shopping cart!
Skinimalism
While 10-step routines were trending for a while, now skinimalism is in. Skinamalism, a.k.a. skin minimalism, is the act of paring back your skincare products to the essentials. Instead of using a bunch of different lower-quality skincare products that only do one thing each, skinimalism focuses on choosing a select few of higher-quality, multi-purpose products that contain multiple beneficial ingredients. Skinimalism frees up time, shelf space, and budget so that you can get the most for less out of your skincare routine.
Skincare-Makeup Hybrids
Speaking of multi-tasking skincare products, skincare-makeup hybrids are another trend that you should take advantage of. Skincare-makeup hybrids can take many forms, including skincare products adopting cosmetic pigments and makeup products incorporating beneficial skincare ingredients. Some examples of skincare-makeup hybrids include tinted sunscreens like our Mineral Sun Shield that offer sheer color and lip glosses that include hydrating ingredients. We expect these boundaries to blur further as this trend continues, so keep an eye out for new skincare-makeup hybrid product drops in the future!

Niacinamide
Niacinamide is the skincare trend that won’t stop, and we are totally here for it. Niacinamide is a powerful multi-tasking ingredient that minimizes enlarged pores, improves uneven skin tone, smooths out fine lines and wrinkles, and brightens a dull complexion. We’ve incorporated niacinamide into several Lancer products, including the Triple Peptide Drops and the Overnight Brightening Mask, in order to harness the power of these amazing ingredients. In fact, you’re probably already using at least one skincare product that contains niacinamide, even if you don’t know it yet — but if you’re not, then you definitely should grab one of our niacinamide products!
Retinol Alternatives
We absolutely love retinol, but understand that not everyone can use it. It’s not recommended for pregnant people, and some people find that it makes their skin really dry and irritated. That’s why we’re so excited about retinol alternatives like bakuchiol and peptides, which have been trending recently and are used in our Gentle Exfoliating Peel Pads. These alternatives are a great option to explore if you’re not sure about using retinol, and they also make an excellent booster if you’re already using retinol. That’s why we formulated our retinol treatment serum with both bakuchiol and retinol, so that you get maximum results.
Lip Care
Not only is the skin around your lips very delicate, but it’s also exposed to many different irritants in the form of food and drink. So it’s no wonder that premium lip care products have been trending recently! These high-quality lip care items go way beyond the cheap lip balm you pick up in the grocery store checkout line. Choose from lip serums, sleeping, and other super-nourishing products that will give you plump, moisturized lips. For best results, apply these products during the day, not only at night when you sleep.
Menopausal Skin
All those hormone surges cause changes in your body, including in your skin, which means that women need to change their skin care during menopause. However, menopausal skin has been largely ignored in the skincare community — until recently. Now, more and more brands are coming out with products such as hydrating oils formulated for menopausal and mature skin, which is a skincare trend we are absolutely loving. If you’re going through menopause, you now have more skincare options than ever before.
Dermatologist Brands
While celebrity skincare has been around for a while, a more recent phenomenon is dermatologist-created skincare. Lancer Skincare is just one example of a skincare line created by a dermatologist. After decades of treating celebrities and other high-profile clients at his Beverly Hills practice, Dr. Harold Lancer decided to launch a skincare line to make his special formulas more widely available to people who don’t live near his clinic. Needless to say, this is one skincare trend that we have been loving, and we can’t wait to see more of it.
At-Home Skincare Devices
At-home skincare devices used to be bulky, expensive, and not that effective. All that is in the past, however, thanks to recent developments in technology that have made at-home skincare devices smaller, more effective, and less expensive. While they can’t match the power of an in-office treatment, at-home skincare devices like our microdermabrasion tool deliver results when used consistently over time. If you haven’t yet tried an at-home skincare devices, there is no better time than now to start trying one today!

Advanced Skincare
Speaking of advancements in skin care, this is true for ingredients as well as technology. Right now, we are seeing more cutting-edge ingredients being developed every day, and luxury skincare brands like Lancer are leading the way with major investments into research and development. We now have an entire line of advanced treatments that were designed to address different skincare concerns, including a retinol treatment for anti-aging, a vitamin C treatment for radiance, and an eye contour cream for lifting and firming. If you’re not sure which treatments are advanced, just look for the all-silver packaging.
Body Care
While the face has gotten most of the attention in the skincare world, we are seeing body care start to trend as well — and we’re not just talking about applying your face skincare to your decollete, either. Consumers are now looking for elevated body care products, including body washes, lotions, serums, and exfoliators, so that they can glow from top to toe. In fact, we released an entire Lancer Method 3-step Skincare Set for the body so that you can get the benefits of our proprietary system for your entire body.
Skincare Supplements
Supplements have been a big trend for a while now, and they’re finally crossing over into the skincare community. Supplements that are specifically designed to support skin health and appearance are now available, especially with a focus on balancing the gut biome. People are also taking vitamin A, C, D, and E, which can help boost the skin as well as other aspects of their health. This is part of a broader trend of internal skincare, whereby people are treating their skin from the inside out as well as the outside in. Just don’t forget to talk to your doctor before adding any new vitamins and supplements.
If you’re ready to hop on some of these skincare trends, then shop the Lancer Skincare online store today!

16 of the Best Skincare Trends to Follow was last modified:  October 31st, 2023 by [email protected]",16 of the Best Skincare Trends to Follow,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/healthy-skin-skincare-trend.jpg
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/how-to-prep-your-skin-for-makeup-expert-tips-advice/,"If you’re an expert at applying makeup, but it’s still not blending right or setting properly, the problem might start before you even apply a lick of foundation to your skin. That’s because if you don’t prep your skin right for makeup, then your cosmetic products won’t look as nice no matter how much you blend them. In this ultimate guide, we offer 16 tips for how to prep your skin for makeup, from exfoliating away dry patches to moisturizing your lips before applying lipstick.
Remove all your old makeup.
Ideally, you should be removing all your makeup at night before you go to sleep, but we know that life sometimes gets in the way. That’s why we formulated our makeup removing wipes for those times when you’re too tired or busy to wash your face. You can also use a cleansing balm or oil cleanser if you’re committed to rinsing your face. Be sure to follow it up with a gentle face wash to get rid of any remaining dirt and debris so that you’ll start with a perfectly clean canvas for new makeup application. For more tips, check out our guide that explains how to remove makeup the right way.
Use cold compresses for puffiness.
Many people wake up with swollen, puffy faces in the morning. This is especially common in side sleepers, since all the blood and lymph drains to one side of their face. If you apply makeup in the morning, you might benefit from applying a cool rag or a cold compress to your face. This will help to reduce swelling and puffiness and make your face appear brighter and more awake. You can do this either before or after washing your face, whatever is your preference. We also recommend using cool water to wash your face to reduce puffiness even further.

Exfoliate your skin regularly.
Makeup will cling to dry, flaky patches of skin, accentuating texture irregularities and making your skin tone look even more uneven. To achieve smooth skin, we recommend establishing a regular exfoliation routine anywhere between one to three times a week depending on how sensitive your skin is. If you haven’t exfoliated in a while and your face is looking scaly, and you need to apply makeup soon, then use a face scrub or a powerful exfoliating mask to get rid of flaky patches quickly. Bear in mind that exfoliating can make your face red and sensitive, so build in some time for your skin to calm down before applying cosmetics.
Try an eye mask or cream.
If you struggle with dark circles and puffy eyes, a concealer will only do so much to cover it up. In fact, heavy layers of concealer can settle into fine lines around your eyes, making their appearance more obvious. Instead, treat the problems at the source by using a dedicated eye mask or cream that is specifically designed to help brighten up tired eyes. Masks will need to be left on for a certain amount of time to get the full benefits (usually 15-20 minutes) so leave yourself enough time to apply and remove the masks. As for eye creams, you just need to let them soak in before applying eye makeup.
Do a face mask.
Masks aren’t just for your eye area! If you need to quickly revitalize your skin before applying makeup, a face mask is the perfect choice. Face masks can offer many benefits, from brightening to soothing to calming to exfoliating, so pick the one that your skin needs most. Masks should typically be applied after using a face cleanser but before any other steps in your skincare routine. Different masks have to be left on for different lengths of time, so follow the instructions on the packaging. Just like with the eye masks, leave yourself plenty of time to do the face mask before you need to apply makeup.
Choose lightweight serums.
If you’re a lover of super thick serums, it’s best to save those for nighttime, since they don’t always sit well underneath makeup. Instead, prioritize lightweight serums that soak in quickly and work well under makeup. You might even want to transition some of your morning serums, which have a more watery texture that soaks in even faster. 

Use a lightweight moisturizer.
On a similar note, you should also avoid wearing very heavy moisturizer beneath makeup, which can make your foundation slide around. However, you shouldn’t skip anti-aging creams entirely, either — applying makeup to unmoisturized skin can make your dry, flaky patches really stand out. Instead, apply a lightweight moisturizer such as a water cream that will soak in quickly and make your face hydrated and glowing. If you have oily skin, look for an oil-free lotion so that it won’t make your face look too greasy as the day goes on.
Give yourself a facial massage.
A facial massage is another great way to get your blood flowing and help the lymph drain out of your face in order to prep your skin for makeup. You can do this at either the serum or the moisturizer step of your morning skincare routine (or both!). All you really need is your hands, but many people enjoy using a jade roller or a gua sha stone for a little extra pampering. If you struggle with puffiness, you can solve the problem by using a stainless steel roller that has been cooled down in the fridge or freezer first.
Discover Our 3-Step Skincare Steps
Never skip your sunscreen.
You should wear sunscreen every day, regardless of whether or not you wear makeup. Even if your makeup claims to have SPF protection, it probably won’t be high enough to really protect your skin (and you probably don’t apply enough to reach the advertised SPF, anyway). Apply sunscreen with a protection of at least SPF 30 to all exposed skin, not just your face but also your neck and chest. Let it set down fully before applying your makeup to ensure that everything stays in place throughout the day.
Don’t apply too many skincare products.
If you’re a fan of the 10-step skincare routine, try to do that at night time only. The more products you pile up on your face, the more likely it is one of them will conflict with your makeup. Instead, keep your morning routines to the essentials, such as balancing toner, vitamin C serum, light moisturizer, and eye cream. Choose multi-tasking products packed full of powerful ingredients that deliver the same benefits in one package. This will also ensure your skincare products soak in faster and you can apply your makeup sooner (more on this in a minute).

Don’t forget about your neck.
Even if you only apply foundation to your face, you’ll still need to blend it over your jawline and down your neck so that you don’t end up with a stark line. If you don’t prep the skin on your neck for makeup, then the makeup may cling to dry patches or settle into lines. When you’re applying your skincare products, bring them down your neck and chest so that the skin in that area will be ready for makeup as well. And you should definitely be applying sunscreen to all exposed skin, including your neck.
Let everything soak in before applying makeup.
If you slap on your skincare and apply your makeup right away, it might not set properly no matter how well you prepped your skin. You should be waiting a minimum of 5-10 minutes between applying your sunscreen (the last step in your skincare routine) and applying your primer for your makeup. If you can, leave yourself even more time to ensure that your skincare is fully soaked in. 
For example, you can wash your face and do your skincare routine right when you wake up, and then let it soak in while you make coffee and eat breakfast. Then you can apply your makeup right before you leave the house.
Make sure your makeup and skincare are compatible.
Sometimes, your makeup won’t set even though you’ve tried every trick in the book. In this case, some ingredients in your makeup might be incompatible with ingredients in your skincare. For instance, if you’re using a water-based moisturizer but a silicone-based foundation, the products will repel each and the makeup will slide around your face. Same goes for your makeup products: Your primer and foundation also need to be based in the same ingredients or they won’t be compatible with one another.

Use a primer as a base layer.
Some people find that their sunscreen works just fine as a primer, especially if it’s more silicone-based. However, other sunscreen formulations may not have the same effect, so if your sunscreen doesn’t fill in your pores or grip onto your makeup, you might want to try using a primer as a base layer. Primers help to smooth out your skin texture and create an even canvas for makeup. They also make your makeup last longer, which is especially helpful for oily skin types. However, people of all skin types can benefit from using a primer to prep their skin for makeup; you just have to find the right one for your skin!
Try a setting spray first.
Many people use setting spray after applying their makeup, but did you know that you can apply it before? It’s true! This trick works especially well for people with oily skin who find that their makeup starts melting after only a couple of hours. Apply your primer first, and then hit with a light mist of setting spray. Don’t spray it too heavily, or the droplets can bead up on the primer and cause it to break apart. You just want a fine, even mist that settles over your face and dries quickly. Blot your face with a damp makeup sponge if necessary before applying your foundation.
Prep your lips.
Even if your face is perfectly moisturized, if your lips are flaking and cracked, that will make it difficult to apply lip gloss or lipstick. Lipstick in particular can be very drying, which is why it’s so important to prep your lips for makeup. You should be exfoliating them regularly to remove dead skin and flaky patches. You should wear a thick lip balm during the night while you are sleeping and on days when you’re not wearing lip color. On the days that you wear lipstick, apply a thin layer of lip balm 10-20 minutes before you apply your lipstick so the more hydrating base coat can dry down.

How to Prep Your Skin for Makeup: Expert Tips & Advice was last modified:  February 8th, 2024 by [email protected]",How to Prep Your Skin for Makeup: Expert Tips & Advice,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/exfoliate-your-skin.jpg
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/skincare-spotlight-everything-you-need-to-know-about-christina-riccis-skincare-routine/,"In case you missed it, we recently announced a partnership with Christina Ricci! The Emmy- and Golden Globe-nominated actor has been hitting the awards circuit recently and relies on Lancer Skincare products to help her get ready for red-carpet walks and award ceremonies.“I am a big fan of Dr. Lancer and visit his clinic every chance I get,” Ricci said. “When I can’t make it to his Beverly Hills office, I will turn to my favorite Lancer Skincare products at home to get ready for all of my big events. Some of my favorites are The Method for face and body plus the Advanced Retinol Treatment.”
Want to get beautiful skin like Christina’s in the comfort of your own home? Then you’re in luck! We’ve rounded up a dozen of the actor’s favorite Lancer Skincare products for the face and body. Here are Christina Ricci’s top skincare recommendations:
The Method: Polish
Christina starts her routine with The Method Polish, which provides gentle exfoliation to smooth out the skin and create an even base for flawless makeup application. The normal-combination skin Polish features multiple ingredients for effective yet gentle exfoliation. Natural minerals like sodium and magnesium create uniform crystals that smooth away dead skin cells. Meanwhile, pumpkin and pomegranate enzymes naturally exfoliate the skin while promoting hydration and infusing it with vitamins for an invigorated complexion.
Use this exfoliator as the first step in your skincare routine for best results. Massage a dime-sized amount all over your face (being careful to avoid the eyes), leave on for about 30 seconds, and then rinse off to reveal your smooth complexion.

The Method: Cleanse
The next step in Christina’s skincare routine is the Method Cleanse face wash, also for normal-combination skin. Christina loves this face wash because it cleanses her face without drying out her skin, so it stays hydrated and glowing. The face wash features rice protein to boost skin hydration and moisture, aloe extract to heal and soothe the skin, and salicylic acid to provide an extra boost of gentle exfoliation and blemish control.
To use this cleanser, your face and hands should be damp with water, but not dripping. Apply a small amount to your palms and work into a lather, and then rub it all over your face and neck. Once again, be careful to avoid the eye area! Rinse the cleanser away with lukewarm and pat your face dry to get it ready for the next step of the Method.
The Method: Nourish
The final step of the three-part Lancer Method is the Method Nourish moisturizer. Christina says that the normal combination one is especially great for daytime wear since it’s not too heavy and sits nicely beneath makeup. It contains peptides to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and helps firm, lift, and smooth skin. The Nourish moisturizer also includes hyaluronic acid to plump the skin and improve hydration, as well as avocado and olive fruit oils to boost moisture retention in the skin.
Using this cream is incredibly simple: Just take a small amount and gently rub it over your face. It’s safe to use around the eye area, too! For best results, we recommend applying the Nourish moisturizer to your neck and decolletage, as well, so that your skin is hydrated and glowing.

Eyes Wide Open Hydrogel Patches
If you saw Christina’s video on Instagram, then you know that she used these Eyes Wide Open Hydrogel patches to prep her skin for the Golden Globes! These eye patches treat puffy eyes, dark circles, fine lines, and wrinkles around the eye area. They are packed full of beneficial ingredients, including vitamin B5 to moisturize and soften, peony root extract to brighten and protect, chamomile flower extract to soothe and generate, and centella asiatica extract to improve microcirculation and increase collagen production.
For proper adhesion, apply the eye patches to freshly clean, dry skin before applying any other leave-on products. The eye patches should be left on for 10-15 minutes so your skin can absorb the beneficial ingredients. After removing the eye patches, follow them up with the Nourish moisturizer or one of our eye creams for an extra boost of hydration.

Lift & Plump Sheet Mask
If you want an all-over mask and not just an eye mask, then check out another product that Christina uses to prep for the red carpet, the Lift & Plump Sheet mask with vegan stem cell complex! It features two key anti-aging ingredients, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3 and Apple Stem Cell Compounds, to provide a more lifted appearance. Sodium hyaluronate improves hydration and suppleness, while rose water offers anti-inflammatory benefits and maintains the skin’s pH balance.
Similar to the eye masks, the sheet mask should be applied to freshly clean, dry skin before applying any other leave-on products. Gently remove and discard the plastic layer and smooth over your face. After leaving on for 10-15 minutes, peel off the mask and discard. Lightly pat any residual serum into your skin — don’t rinse your skin, or you’ll wash away those beneficial ingredients.
Advanced Retinol Treatment
The Advanced Retinol Treatment is another one of Christina’s favorite products. Retinol encourages the products of collagen and elastin in the skin, which helps to prevent signs of premature aging and smooth out the appearance of existing lines and wrinkles.
This treatment features our CoRetinol technology, which is a powerful blend of 1.25% Retinol, Bakuchiol, and a Soy Complex. It also incorporates marine-sourced hydrolyzed collagen to further hydrate the skin and improve moisture. Meanwhile, squalane helps to soften and condition the skin to improve elasticity. Finally, prickly pear extract — which is rich in antioxidants, flavonoids, magnesium, and iron — improves the look of redness and hydration.
The Lancer Advanced Retinol Treatment should only be used at night, since it makes the skin sensitive to the sun. Apply no more than two pumps to the skin in a thin layer; applying more may result in irritation. You may wish to use it every other night to start off until your skin adjusts. Be sure to use sunscreen and limit sun exposure during the day to minimize the risk of irritation.

Caviar Acid Lime Peel
If you’re in need of some serious exfoliation before a big event, then Christina recommends the Caviar Acid Lime Peel. This powerful product features 10% glycolic acid and 10% phytic acid to quickly resurface the skin. Caviar Lime Extract, papaya enzymes, and pineapple enzymes increase the exfoliation even more.
Because of the high concentration of ingredients, this peel should only be left on the skin for 10-15 minutes max. Avoid the eyes, lips, and broken skin when applying the product to your face. You may experience a mild tingle as the product begins to work. After the 10-15 minutes are up, rinse your face and pat it dry.

Dani Glowing Skin Perfector
You may have seen on Instagram that Christina used this product to get ready for the Critic’s Choice Awards! Named after Dr. Lancer’s wife, the Dani Glowing Skin Perfector is an innovative illuminating skin finisher that instantly makes your skin glow. The lightweight cream features micro-fine, light-catching mineral highlighters to create a lit-from-within glow. It also incorporates an Asian botanical blend of Evodia Fruit and Buchu Leaf Extracts to help maintain even skin tone and luminosity.
The Dani Glowing Skin Perfector can be applied to the high points of the face before or after makeup application. It can also be blended with foundation to create an all-over glow if you prefer a more diffuse look.
The Method Body Polish
If you’ve seen Christina on the red carpet, then you know that she glows from head to toe. This is because she uses our Method Body set, starting with the exfoliating Polish! The Method Body Polish combines chemical and physical exfoliants to smooth out your entire body. Salicylic acid, ascorbic acid, and retinol break down dead skin cells while quartz crystals and bamboo powder sweep them away. Shea butter nourishes the skin as it’s being polished to ensure that it doesn’t dry out.
The Method Body Cleanse
After she’s done exfoliating, Christina uses the Method Body Cleanse to wash her skin without drying it out. This unique gel-to-cream delivers a luxurious shower experience, thanks to watermelon seed oil, which cleanses the skin without stripping away essential oils. Meanwhile, Kigelia Fruit Extract and Marula Oil provide a silky texture to assist with shaving while glycolic and salicylic acids rinse away any remaining dead skin cells.
The Method Body Nourish
Christina finishes up her body care routine with the Method Body Nourish. This moisturizer features a proprietary skin moisturizing compound called Hylaplex® that combines a cross-linked form of hyaluronic acid with peptides and phytocompounds. This unique formula helps to plump skin’s appearance and provide long-lasting moisturization. For best results, apply to slightly damp skin to lock in moisture.

Red Carpet Ready Set

In addition to many of the products we have already talked about, it also includes a deluxe sample bottle of Omega Hydrating Oil with Ferment Complex.

Skincare Spotlight: Everything You Need to Know About Christina Ricci’s Skincare Routine was last modified:  February 15th, 2024 by [email protected]",Skincare Spotlight: Everything You Need to Know About Christina Ricci’s Skincare Routine,https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Skincare-Routine-Steps.jpg
https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/winter-skincare-101-tips-advice-more/,"Winter can be incredibly tough on your skin, and many people struggle with dryness and irritation during the colder months. Fortunately, having the proper winter skincare routine can help you achieve a smooth, glowing complexion even when the weather outside is cold and stormy. Here are 15 tips to help you create an effective winter skincare routine this season:
Switch to gentle cleansers.
Cleansing is a necessary first step in your skincare routine, but it can also be one of the most drawing and stripping. Even in the wintertime, your facial cleanser should leave your face feeling clean and free of residue but not dry or tight. If you feel like your current cleanser is too drying, then switch to a cream or milk cleanser, which will be more gentle than a gel or foaming cleanser. You might also want to choose a more emollient makeup remover, such as a cleansing oil or cleansing bomb, to use before your face wash.
Try skipping your morning face wash.
If you are already using a cream or milk cleanser, and still feel like your face is dry and tight after washing it, then you might consider skipping your morning face wash. Cleansing at night is very important because you want to remove sunscreen, makeup, dirt, sweat, and other impurities from your skin before going to sleep. However, you can get away with just splashing your face with cold water in the morning if you find that using a cleanser twice a day is too much for your skin. The water will help rinse away any remaining residue without drying your skin out too much so you can start with a clean canvas in the morning.
Avoid alcohol-based products.
Many skincare products, especially those targeted toward oily skin, are formulated with alcohol, so they will quickly dry up and set down. Unfortunately, alcohol can be extremely drying to your skin, especially in the wintertime. If you are struggling with a lot of dryness, we recommend carefully reading the ingredient labels of all of your skincare products to see if any of them contain alcohol. You might be surprised to discover how many skin care products alcohol is in! Swap these out for alcohol-free alternatives to see if that helps your skin during the colder weather.

Re-evaluate your retinol.
Besides sunscreen, retinol is one of the most effective skincare products for anti-aging. Retinols and retinoids encourage the production of collagen and elastin, acting as a dark spot remover and helping to prevent the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. However, retinol is known to be very drying to the skin, so you may need to reevaluate your use in the wintertime. You may wish to reduce the frequency to only a couple times per week. You might also want to switch from a prescription retinol or stronger retinol to a more gentle retinoid derivative if you feel like your current product is too powerful.
Consider exfoliating less often.
When your skin is scaly and peeling, you might be tempted to exfoliate it more frequently to try to achieve a smooth complexion and even skin tone. While this may seem logical, exfoliating is very drying to your skin and can often backfire, making it more dry and irritated. Instead, we recommend reducing exfoliation to only one or two times a week if your skin has been dry lately. You should also be careful with powerful leave-in exfoliants, which will be even more intense if they are layered underneath a thick moisturizer. For more information, see our guide that explains how to exfoliate the face.
Try a thicker moisturizer.
Switching to a thicker quality facial moisturizer is one of the most important changes that you can make to your skincare routine during the wintertime. If you are currently using a lightweight lotion or a water gel cream, it’s time to switch to a thicker moisturizer that will help to nourish your skin. Look for ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and high-quality fruit oils, which will create an inclusive barrier on the skin and promote a healthy balance of natural oils. If you don’t like to wear a heavy moisturizer during the day, then prioritize using a thicker balm at night when you sleep.
Experiment with using face oil at night.
If you find that even a thick moisturizer or face balm isn’t cutting it, then you might want to try a facial oil at night. These ultra-nourishing oils can be mixed directly into your moisturizer or applied as the final layer in your nighttime skincare routine. The oils helped to form an occlusive barrier on your face to slow down the rate of water evaporation. They also contribute to a healthy balance of natural oils, which can be tough to achieve during the wintertime.

Keep using sunscreen.
Sunscreen isn’t just for the summer; you should keep wearing it in the wintertime. While you might not be getting as much sun compared to other seasons, UV rays do penetrate through windows, which can contribute to premature aging like fine lines and wrinkles and also increase your risk of developing skin cancer later on. Find a moisturizing, non-drying, anti-aging sunscreen and apply it to all exposed skin — not just your face, but also your ears, neck, and chest — every single day. And if you’re recreating outside, then you need to be reapplying the sunscreen every two hours.
Incorporate a face mask into your routine.
Like eyelash serums, face masks are an optional part of any skincare routine, but they can be a great solution for dry and irritated skin. In the winter, we recommend avoiding exfoliating and brightening masks, which can dry the skin out further. Instead, prioritize soothing and hydrating masks that will give your skin the nourishment that it needs when temperatures are low and the air is dry. You can use face masks as much or as little as you want; aiming for at least once per week is a good place to start.
Find Your 3-Step Skincare Method
Take care of your lips and hands.
If most of your skincare routine focuses on your face, then definitely don’t forget to take care of your lips and hands as well during the winter. The skin on your lips is very delicate, and it’s also exposed to a lot of irritants in the form of food and drink, which is why your lips often peel and crack in the wintertime. You are probably also washing your hands more often since it’s cold and flu season, which dries out your hands as well. To counteract this, wear lip care products and hand lotion throughout the day, and then apply a thicker lip mask and hand cream at night while you sleep to help the skin repair itself.
Get a humidifier.
Running the heat during the winter reduces the humidity in the air, which dries your face out even more. To help counteract this, consider getting a humidifier to put some moisture back into the air. We recommend running the humidifier at night, at the very least, and you can also get one for your workspace to run during the day if you have extremely dry skin. 
We also suggest choosing a cool mist humidifier, which will help reduce the formation of mildew and mold. You should use filtered or distilled water in your humidifier to prevent mineral deposits and debris from clogging the device. It will need to be cleaned often but can make a significant difference for dry skin and sinus passages in the wintertime.

Stay hydrated from the inside out.
On the subject of water, it’s really important to keep your body hydrated from the inside out during the winter time even if you’re not sweating that much. We know that it can be difficult to motivate yourself to drink a bunch of ice water when the temperature is low, so we recommend finding some caffeine-free herbal teas in flavors that you enjoy so you can have a hot beverage while staying hydrated. Also try to limit your intake of caffeinated and alcoholic beverages, which have a dehydrating effect on your body.
Use lukewarm water to bathe.
A hot shower during the winter can feel amazing, but it dries out your skin. It’s better to use lukewarm water that is neither too cold nor too hot for bathing, showering, and washing your face. We also recommend limiting baths or showers to no more than 5 to 10 minutes since prolonged exposure to water will also dry out your skin, no matter what the temperature of the water is. If you are struggling with dry skin on your body, apply lotion to still-damp skin while you are in the shower to lock in that moisture.
Limit your time outside when possible.
Cold temperatures, harsh wind, and precipitation are tough on your skin. For that reason, we recommend limiting your time outside during the winter, especially if there’s inclement weather or the temperatures are very cold. If you know that you will be going outside that day, then you might want to use thicker moisturizers and lip balms to ensure that your skin gets the protection and nourishment that it needs so that the elements don’t irritate it too much.
Protect your skin from the elements.
When you do go outside, protecting your skin from the elements is essential. Wear jackets and weather-resistant pants, and be sure to cover any exposed skin with hats, gloves, and scarves. You may want to wear a breathable base layer made from cotton or Merino wool next to your skin if you find synthetic fabrics like polyester touching your skin irritating it. Layering clothes will also allow you to take off the outer layers if you find yourself getting overheated or sweaty, particularly if you are going from inside to outside and back again.

https://www.lancerskincare.com/blog/how-to-get-rid-of-oily-skin/#more-1121,"Though each skin type comes with its own challenges, oily skin can be particularly frustrating. Oily skin is hard to control as it is affected by hormone fluctuations, the weather, and your level of activity each day. As a result of your oily skin, you may end up with shiny skin, makeup that slides off, and enlarged or clogged pores. Despite many “mattifying” products’ claims to control and reduce oil, the best way to treat oily skin is proper skincare.

When it comes to caring for oily skin, the right skincare is vital. Although it may seem counterintuitive, you’ll want to be careful not to over-dry your skin. Even though it might seem like drying up the oil on your skin is a good idea, you need a certain amount of healthy oils in your skin to maintain skin health and moisture. Over-drying and irritating products rob your skin of beneficial oils and moisture and can cause dryness, itchiness, redness, and spur more chronic skin conditions like rosacea or chronic acne. Moreover, skin that has been stripped of necessary moisture can begin to overproduce oil, causing further oiliness and clogged pores.
It’s helpful to know what causes oily skin so that you can begin to treat it properly. Oily skin is, in part, hereditary, but it can be exacerbated by irritation that stimulates the nerve endings within the base of your pores, causing your skin to produce excess oil. This irritation can be caused by any number of factors, including stress, hormone variations, harsh cleansers or soaps, and free radicals in the environment.
So how can you begin to manage your oily skin without the negative side effects of over-drying or irritation? First, make sure you know how to polish your skin without overdoing it. Exfoliants that are overly abrasive can damage your skin, resulting in redness, irritation, more breakouts, and even hyperpigmentation. Instead, you want to polish your skin gently in order to resurface skin and clear away the dead skin cells, sebum, and bacteria that can clog your pores. Ideally, your polish will utilize both salicylic acid—a Beta Hydroxy Acid that reaches deep into pores—and a gentle, natural exfoliating ingredient to naturally polish your skin and clear away pore-clogging buildup. The Method: Polish Blemish Control uses both salicylic acid and uniform mineral crystal and sodium bicarbonate to gently polish skin and help clear your pores. The unique formulation of this exfoliator ensures that your skin is gently resurfaced for a radiant glow.
Once you’ve chosen the ideal product to polish your skin, choose a cleanser that gently removes all dirt, residual makeup, exfoliation debris, and excess oil without stripping the skin of essential hydration. No residue should be left behind as that can contribute to clogged pores and blemish-causing irritation. Your skin should not feel tight or dry after washing, nor should it necessarily be squeaky clean, as that can indicate a loss of moisture. Avoid any cleanser using alcohol, as alcohol can dehydrate the skin, leading to  irritation or excessive oil production. A cleanser containing salicylic acid, however, will help manage  excess surface oil and help keep pores clear and clean without removing hydration. The Method: Cleanse Blemish Control contains salicylic acid and tea tree oil to keep pores clear and assist in removing dead skin cells and pore-clogging sebum. After cleansing, skin should feel refreshed and look healthy and clean. Use your ideal cleanser twice daily—in the morning and at night—to help manage and normalize your oil levels. Use warm water, rather than hot, to minimize irritation while still opening pores and rinsing the cleanser away completely.
Though many skincare lines suggest toner to minimize pores and remove final traces of makeup, toners often contain drying and irritating alcohol. Overusing toner can lead to skin that is parched and more easily irritated. The drying properties of toner can also lead your skin to produce too much oil, making your skin even oilier and compounding the problem.   Dr. Lancer specifically developed The Lancer Method to be effective and not require a toner – allowing the Cleanse, when following Polish  to be highly effective.
Next, it’s important to choose a moisturizer that provides essential hydration and nourishment to your skin, without clogging your pores. Remember that dehydrated skin will only produce more oil, so despite the fact that it may seem contradictory, you need to moisturize your skin daily. If necessary, you can vary the amount of moisturizer you apply to each area of your face, depending on the oiliness in that area. Choose a moisturizer that is lightweight, rather than a highly emollient cream that may be too heavy for oily skin. The right moisturizer should sink into your skin and provide moisture without leaving your skin greasy. The Method: Nourish Blemish Control is an ultra-light moisturizer that provides vital hydration and still fights acne. This product contains salicylic acid and lilac stem cells to help manage oil production for clear pores , while nasturtium flower extract provides a healthy glow for radiant-looking skin. Additionally, a powerful antioxidant—rare grape polyphenol, õ-viniferin—helps protect your skin from the aging effects of the environment.
Even oily skin needs sunscreen, but many sunscreens are heavy, thick, and can clog pores. Still, you need to protect your skin, and it is recommended that a sunscreen with a broad spectrum SPF of 30 be used. In order to avoid aggravating oily skin, look for lightweight sunscreens that absorb completely and do not leave a greasy film on the skin.  Sheer Fluid Sun Shield Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen is a weightless and fresh feeling sunscreen that also works as a makeup primer. The broad spectrum SPF protects your skin from damaging UV rays, while sunflower sprout and chamomile extracts soothe your skin and help provide radiance without oiliness.
After you’ve identified your ideal skincare regimen and you begin to manage your skin, you may find that your skin still has a bit of a sheen at the end of the day. If so, you can use additional products to help manage that excess oil. Oil-blotting papers are an ideal way to manage oiliness without adding any additional products to your routine and risking further drying or irritation. Oil-blotting papers simply absorb the oil on the surface of your skin, so you can toss it in the trash. Just press the paper lightly onto oily areas for 10 to 20 seconds, then remove and discard.
You’ll also want to make sure you wear makeup that is non-comedogenic and isn’t too heavy. Anything heavy, oily, greasy, or waxy runs the risk of clogging your pores and adding to the oil on your skin. If possible, skip heavier foundations that may have emollient ingredients and, instead, opt for powder mineral makeup or light mousse formulas. Regardless of whichever makeup you decide on using, check to make sure the formula won’t clog pores and be diligent about removing your makeup at night. If you wear waterproof or long-wear formulas, try using gentle Makeup Removing Wipes before The Lancer Method to remove as much makeup as possible and allow your skincare to work properly on your oily skin.
In addition to skincare, keep in mind that your lifestyle can have an impact on your skin as well. Eating as clean as you can—plenty of organic fruits and vegetables and other healthy, whole foods—can also help ensure healthy skin. Avoid fast food, white bread, and non-organic animal products that may include additional hormones, antibiotics, pesticides and other additives that can adversely affect your skin. Drinking plenty of water will keep your skin hydrated and help your body flush toxins, too.
Exercise is another way to rid your body of toxins and impurities, as well as encouraging increased circulation in your skin. Be aware, however, that exercising can temporarily increase oil production. Be sure to remove your makeup before exercising to ensure that oil and sweat don’t get trapped beneath your makeup, clogging pores and causing blemishes. Shower promptly after exercise as well to ensure that you wash away all the excess oil and impurities in your sweat that can clog pores once reabsorbed into the skin.
Keep an eye on when your skin seems oiliest and vary your skincare routine accordingly. Many people find that their skin is much oilier in the summer than in the winter. This may mean that you’ll need more moisture and less oil-managing salicylic acid in the winter months. Hormones can also affect your skin’s oil production, as can your workout routine. Be aware of when your skin is oiliest, and when it’s not, so that you can adjust your skincare regimen as needed and avoid over-drying or irritating your skin.
If you’ve followed our advice and still can’t find relief for your oily skin, seek help from an experienced dermatologist like Dr. Harold Lancer. Laser treatments and chemical peels can be used to treat oily skin, but only a dermatologist can determine what will help your skin without irritating it more and aggravating further oil production.
Ultimately, oily skin can be a blessing as long as you maintain it properly and keep the oil under control. With proper care, the extra moisture in your skin can result in skin that looks younger longer. Be attentive to your oily skin with the right skincare, treatments, and proper maintenance, and you’ll be able to fend off breakouts and enjoy skin that is supple, soft, and balanced.
